# History of interaction with the task:

## step 0

<think>
The task is to find all offers for the "Kingston 1TB NV2 M.2 NVMe SSD" across four webshops. The current page is the solution submission page, so I need to visit each webshop, search for the product, and collect the URLs of all matching offers. I will start by opening the first webshop, E-Store Athletes, to search for the product.

Next, I need to check the last webshop, Hardware Cafe, for offers. I will navigate to its homepage.
</think>

</memory>

## step 10

<think>

# Action space:
Note: This action set allows you to interact with your environment. Most of them
are python function executing playwright code. The primary way of referring to
elements in the page is through bid which are specified in your observations.


15 different types of actions are available.

noop(wait_ms: float = 1000)
scroll(delta_x: float, delta_y: float)
keyboard_press(key: str)
click(bid: str, button: Literal['left', 'middle', 'right'] = 'left', modifiers: list[typing.Literal['Alt', 'Control', 'ControlOrMeta', 'Meta', 'Shift']] = [])
fill(bid: str, value: str)
hover(bid: str)
tab_focus(index: int)
new_tab()
go_back()
go_forward()
goto(url: str)
tab_close()
select_option(bid: str, options: str | list[str])
send_msg_to_user(text: str)
report_infeasible(reason: str)
Only a single action can be provided at once. Example:
fill('a12', 'example with "quotes"')

Note:
* Some tasks may be game like and may require to interact with the mouse position
in x, y coordinates.
* Some text field might have auto completion. To see it, you have to type a few
characters and wait until next step.
* If you have to cut and paste, don't forget to select the text first.
* Coordinate inside an SVG are relative to it's top left corner.
* Make sure to use bid to identify elements when using commands.
* Interacting with combobox, dropdowns and auto-complete fields can be tricky,
sometimes you need to use select_option, while other times you need to use fill
or click and wait for the reaction of the page.


# Abstract Example

Here is an abstract version of the answer with description of the content of
each tag. Make sure you follow this structure, but replace the content with your
answer:

<think>
Think step by step. If you need to make calculations such as coordinates, write them here. Describe the effect
that your previous action had on the current content of the page.
</think>

<memory>
Write down anything you need to remember for next steps. You will be presented
with the list of previous memories and past actions. Some tasks require to
remember hints from previous steps in order to solve it.
</memory>

<action>
One single action to be executed. You can only use one action at a time.
</action>


# Concrete Example

Here is a concrete example of how to format your answer.
Make sure to follow the template with proper tags:

<think>
From previous action I tried to set the value of year to "2022",
using select_option, but it doesn't appear to be in the form. It may be a
dynamic dropdown, I will try using click with the bid "a324" and look at the
response from the page.
</think>

<memory>
I clicked on bid "32" to activate tab 2. The accessibility tree should mention
focusable for elements of the form at next step.
</memory>

<action>
click('a324')
</action>
