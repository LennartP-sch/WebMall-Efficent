# History of interaction with the task:

## step 0

<think>
The task is to find all offers for the "Kingston 1TB NV2 M.2 NVMe SSD" across four webshops. I am currently on the solution submission page. The first step is to visit one of the webshops and search for the product. I will start with E-Store Athletes (https://webmall-1.informatik.uni-mannheim.de) and search for "Kingston 1TB NV2 M.2 NVMe SSD".
</think>

<action>
goto('https://webmall-1.informatik.uni-mannheim.de')
</action>

## step 1

<think>
The homepage of E-Store Athletes does not show the Kingston 1TB NV2 M.2 NVMe SSD among the featured products. There is a search box available at the top of the page. The most efficient next step is to use the search function to look for "Kingston 1TB NV2 M.2 NVMe SSD" directly.
</think>

<action>
fill('223', 'Kingston 1TB NV2 M.2 NVMe SSD')
</action>

## step 2

<think>
I have already filled the search box with "Kingston 1TB NV2 M.2 NVMe SSD". The next logical step is to click the "Search" button to execute the search and see if there are any relevant offers for this SSD on E-Store Athletes.
</think>

<action>
click('224')
</action>

## step 3

<think>
The search results page for E-Store Athletes shows two identical offers for the "Kingston 1TB NV2 M.2 NVMe SSD, M.2 2280, PCIe4, R/W 3500/2100 MB/S" at 99,99 â‚¬. Both links point to the same product URL: https://webmall-1.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/product/kingston-1tb-nv2-m-2-nvme-ssd-m-2-2280-pcie4-r-w-3500-2100-mb-s/. I have now found the offer on this shop. The next step is to search for the same product on the next webshop, TechTalk.
</think>

<action>
goto('https://webmall-2.informatik.uni-mannheim.de')
</action>

## step 4

<think>
I am on the TechTalk homepage. To efficiently find the Kingston 1TB NV2 M.2 NVMe SSD, I should use the search functionality. There is a visible search textbox labeled "Search products...". I will enter the product name "Kingston 1TB NV2 M.2 NVMe SSD" into the search box.
</think>

<action>
fill('224', 'Kingston 1TB NV2 M.2 NVMe SSD')
</action>

## step 5

<think>
I have already filled the search box with "Kingston 1TB NV2 M.2 NVMe SSD" on the TechTalk webshop. The next logical step is to click the search button next to the textbox to execute the search and see if there are any relevant offers for this SSD on TechTalk.
</think>

<action>
click('267')
</action>

## step 6

<think>
The search results page on TechTalk indicates "No products were found matching your selection" for "Kingston 1TB NV2 M.2 NVMe SSD". This means there are no offers for this product on TechTalk. The next step is to check the next webshop, CamelCases, for the product by navigating to its homepage.
</think>

<action>
goto('https://webmall-3.informatik.uni-mannheim.de')
</action>

## step 7

<think>
I am on the CamelCases homepage. To efficiently check for the Kingston 1TB NV2 M.2 NVMe SSD, I should use the search functionality. There is a visible search textbox labeled "Search products...". I will enter the product name "Kingston 1TB NV2 M.2 NVMe SSD" into the search box.
</think>

<action>
fill('82', 'Kingston 1TB NV2 M.2 NVMe SSD')
</action>

## step 8

<think>
I have filled the search box with "Kingston 1TB NV2 M.2 NVMe SSD" on CamelCases. The next logical step is to click the search button next to the textbox to execute the search and see if there are any relevant offers for this SSD on CamelCases.
</think>

<action>
click('117')
</action>

## step 9

<think>
The search for "Kingston 1TB NV2 M.2 NVMe SSD" on CamelCases has already been performed in a previous step, and I am now on the product page for this SSD at CamelCases. The URL is: https://webmall-3.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/product/kingston-1tb-nv2-m-2-nvme-ssd-m-2-2280-pcie4-r-w-3500-2100-mb-s/. I have now found the offer on CamelCases. The next step is to check the last webshop, Hardware Cafe, for the product by navigating to its homepage.
</think>

<action>
goto('https://webmall-4.informatik.uni-mannheim.de')
</action>

## step 10

<think>
I am on the Hardware Cafe homepage. To efficiently check for the Kingston 1TB NV2 M.2 NVMe SSD, I should use the search functionality. There is a visible search box labeled "Search" near the top of the page. I will enter "Kingston 1TB NV2 M.2 NVMe SSD" into the search box to look for the product.
</think>

<action>
fill('111', 'Kingston 1TB NV2 M.2 NVMe SSD')
</action>

## step 11

<think>
I have filled the search box on Hardware Cafe with "Kingston 1TB NV2 M.2 NVMe SSD". The next logical step is to click the "Search Now" button to execute the search and see if there are any relevant offers for this SSD on Hardware Cafe.
</think>

<action>
click('113')
</action>

## step 12

<think>
The search results page on Hardware Cafe for "Kingston 1TB NV2 M.2 NVMe SSD" states: "No products were found matching your selection." This means there are no offers for this product on Hardware Cafe. 

I have now checked all four webshops:
- E-Store Athletes: Offer found
- TechTalk: No offer
- CamelCases: Offer found
- Hardware Cafe: No offer

The URLs for the offers found are:
1. https://webmall-1.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/product/kingston-1tb-nv2-m-2-nvme-ssd-m-2-2280-pcie4-r-w-3500-2100-mb-s/
2. https://webmall-3.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/product/kingston-1tb-nv2-m-2-nvme-ssd-m-2-2280-pcie4-r-w-3500-2100-mb-s/

The next step is to go to the solution page and submit these URLs as the final result, separated by three ### as instructed.
</think>

<action>
goto('https://webmall-0.informatik.uni-mannheim.de')
</action>

## step 13

<think>
I am back on the solution submission page. I have found two offers for the Kingston 1TB NV2 M.2 NVMe SSD: one on E-Store Athletes and one on CamelCases. According to the instructions, I need to enter both URLs separated by three ### into the text field and then submit the result. The URLs are:
https://webmall-1.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/product/kingston-1tb-nv2-m-2-nvme-ssd-m-2-2280-pcie4-r-w-3500-2100-mb-s/
https://webmall-3.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/product/kingston-1tb-nv2-m-2-nvme-ssd-m-2-2280-pcie4-r-w-3500-2100-mb-s/
I will now fill the text field with these URLs separated by three ###.
</think>

<action>
fill('11', 'https://webmall-1.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/product/kingston-1tb-nv2-m-2-nvme-ssd-m-2-2280-pcie4-r-w-3500-2100-mb-s/###https://webmall-3.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/product/kingston-1tb-nv2-m-2-nvme-ssd-m-2-2280-pcie4-r-w-3500-2100-mb-s/')
</action>

# Action space:
Note: This action set allows you to interact with your environment. Most of them
are python function executing playwright code. The primary way of referring to
elements in the page is through bid which are specified in your observations.


15 different types of actions are available.

noop(wait_ms: float = 1000)
scroll(delta_x: float, delta_y: float)
keyboard_press(key: str)
click(bid: str, button: Literal['left', 'middle', 'right'] = 'left', modifiers: list[typing.Literal['Alt', 'Control', 'ControlOrMeta', 'Meta', 'Shift']] = [])
fill(bid: str, value: str)
hover(bid: str)
tab_focus(index: int)
new_tab()
go_back()
go_forward()
goto(url: str)
tab_close()
select_option(bid: str, options: str | list[str])
send_msg_to_user(text: str)
report_infeasible(reason: str)
Only a single action can be provided at once. Example:
fill('a12', 'example with "quotes"')

Note:
* Some tasks may be game like and may require to interact with the mouse position
in x, y coordinates.
* Some text field might have auto completion. To see it, you have to type a few
characters and wait until next step.
* If you have to cut and paste, don't forget to select the text first.
* Coordinate inside an SVG are relative to it's top left corner.
* Make sure to use bid to identify elements when using commands.
* Interacting with combobox, dropdowns and auto-complete fields can be tricky,
sometimes you need to use select_option, while other times you need to use fill
or click and wait for the reaction of the page.


# Abstract Example

Here is an abstract version of the answer with description of the content of
each tag. Make sure you follow this structure, but replace the content with your
answer:

<think>
Think step by step. If you need to make calculations such as coordinates, write them here. Describe the effect
that your previous action had on the current content of the page.
</think>

<action>
One single action to be executed. You can only use one action at a time.
</action>


# Concrete Example

Here is a concrete example of how to format your answer.
Make sure to follow the template with proper tags:

<think>
From previous action I tried to set the value of year to "2022",
using select_option, but it doesn't appear to be in the form. It may be a
dynamic dropdown, I will try using click with the bid "a324" and look at the
response from the page.
</think>

<action>
click('a324')
</action>
