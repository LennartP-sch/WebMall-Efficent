Setting a new standard for versatility, this full-frame mirrorless camera features a newly developed 45MP CMOS sensor, which offers 8K raw video recording, 12 fps continuous shooting with a mechanical shutter, and is the first EOS camera to feature 5-axis sensor-shift image stabilization.nBeyond just resolution, the sensor also pairs with the refined DIGIC X image processor to usher in a new generation of Dual Pixel CMOS AF for quick, smooth, and intelligent focusing performance using 1053 selectable points that cover the entire field of view. This focusing system has also been updated to make use of Deep Learning technology for improved subject tracking as well as precise eye, face, and head-detection for both people and animals.nComplementing the imaging assets, the R5, while sporting a new design, also feels familiar to EOS 5-series users. An especially high-resolution 5.76m-dot electronic viewfinder provides a realistic 120 fps refresh rate while the rear touchscreen LCD monitor sports a vari-angle design to accommodate vlogging needs as well as benefit working from high and low angles. A top status makes for an intuitive workflow and the camera also incorporates dual memory card slots—one CFexpress Type B, one SD UHS-II—along with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi wireless connectivity.nnnnnnnn45MP Full-Frame Sensor and DIGIC X ProcessornnBuilt around a newly developed 45MP full-frame CMOS sensor, the EOS R5 offers both high-resolution stills and video output and the fine-tuned DIGIC X image processor complements this with a wealth of speed. Sensitivity from ISO 100-51200, which can be expanded to ISO 102400, suits working in a variety of lighting conditions while quick continuous shooting up to 12 fps with a mechanical shutter, or silent 20 fps with an electronic shutter, is ideal for working with moving subjects.nnnnnn8K30 Raw and 4K120 Video RecordingnnBenefitting more than just stills, the 45MP full-frame sensor also enables impressively high-resolution DCI and UHD 8K 30 fps raw video recording internally along with 4K recording up to 120 fps in 4:2:2 10-bit with Canon Log. HDR-PQ recording is possible, too, in-camera HDR production and external recording, via the HDMI port supports a clean 4K output at up to 60 fps. Both All-I and IPB compression options are available, along with the ability to use Dual Pixel CMOS AF when shooting at up to 8K raw.nnnnnnDual Pixel CMOS AFnnAn updated Dual Pixel CMOS AF features 1053 selectable focusing points, which cover approximately 100% of the image frame for wide and even coverage. This focusing system offers smooth and fast focusing performance in a similar manner to how a camcorder acquires focus. This system integrates two separate photodiodes within each pixel to provide a broad and dense network of phase-detection gathering elements across a majority of the image sensor to reduce focus hunting for faster, more direct control of focus placement. When working with still imagery, this focusing system works to acquire focus quickly and accurately, making it ideally suited to shooting and tracking moving subjects so that critical focus is attained with each shot. When shooting video, a Movie Servo AF mode offers smooth and natural focusing when changing from different subjects or different distances within the scene, as well as the ability to specify tracking sensitivity, AF speed, and Face Tracking priority. Benefited by the Touch AF system, rack focus is possible simply by touching elements within the scene on the touchscreen in order to change focus in an intuitive manner. Subject tracking in movies is also heightened due to the Dual Pixel CMOS AF system's ability to recognize subjects and maintain focus when working within changing or cluttered scenery.Subject tracking has also been benefitted through the use of Deep Learning technology, which helps to gradually refine the focusing system's ability to quickly and accurately recognize both people and animal subjects. This technology also supports the more refined eye, face, and head detection functions, for both people and animals, that are well-suited for portraiture applications.nnnnnnSensor-Shift Image StabilizernnA first for EOS cameras, the R5 incorporates five-axis sensor-shift image stabilization that compensates for up to an impressive eight stops of camera shake for truly effective compensation of camera shake to suit handheld shooting with slower shutter speeds. This stabilization system also works in concert with lens-based optical image stabilization for both native RF lenses and adapted EF lenses.nnnnnnBody Design and Wireless ConnectivitynnnnHigh-resolution 5.67m-dot 0.5"" electronic viewfinder provides a bright and detailed means for eye-level viewing and the quick 120 fps refresh rate offers natural motion rendering for a more realistic viewfinder experience.nRear 3.2"" LCD touchscreen features a vari-angle design that benefits front-facing recording, such as for vlogging needs, as well as working from high and low shooting angles.nTop status LCD can be used to quickly review camera and shooting settings.nCFexpress Type B and SD UHS-II memory card slots are featured for flexible storage needs; the CFexpress slot is ideal for 8K video and high-speed, high-resolution burst shooting needs while the SD card slot retains a familiar form factor for wide compatibility.nBoth a 3.5mm headphone and a 3.5mm external microphone port are featured for improved audio monitoring and recording capabilities.nRefined body design incorporates four distinct control dials across the body for intuitive tactile control and a joystick controller is used on the back of the camera for fast and intuitive focus point selection and menu navigation.nDurable, weather-sealed body design is built to handle tough working conditions and inclement weather.nBoth 5 GHz and 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi bands are available for fast file transferring to a mobile device and Bluetooth is also available to provide constant device connection via the Canon Camera Connect app.nnnnnnnnRF 24-105mm f/4L IS USM LensnnIncluded with the camera body is the versatile RF 24-105mm f/4L IS USM lens; a standard zoom covering wide-angle to portrait-length focal lengths. Its f/4 constant maximum aperture maintains consistent performance throughout the zoom range and suits working in a variety of lighting conditions. An Image Stabilizer also suits photographing in low-light by compensating for the effects of camera shake to result in sharper imagery when shooting handheld. Benefitting both stills and video applications, it also has an Ultrasonic Motor that delivers quick, quiet, and precise autofocus performance along with full-time manual focus override.nnnnn",,,taxable,,1,,,0,0,,,,,1,,,"4000,0",Cameras > Digital > Canon,Other Electronics,,,https://webmall-1.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/3129.jpg,,,,,,,,,0,

Thanks to this, shooting in less than ideal lighting conditions or with slower lenses is no longer a limitation. Expandable up to 10,400, the R5 will be able to capture detail and retain image quality in nearly any lighting environment thanks to the DIGIC X.nBigger files does not mean slower performancenUnlike previous high resolution digital cameras, the added resolution of the EOS R5 does not come at the expense of speed. Shooting speeds of up to 12 fps with the mechanical shutter, or 20 fps when shooting with the electronic silent shutter, allows photographers to capture split-second details among even the fastest-moving subjects. Whether it’s a snowboarder in the half pipe, or a bride assaulting her new hubby with the wedding cake, subjects will be captured in full detail, with autofocus keeping them tack-sharp throughout the shooting sequence.nIn-Body Image Stabilizer IBISnThe EOS R5 is Canon’s first camera to incorporate a 5-axis in-body image stabilization (IBIS). Thanks to this new system, any lens used on the EOS R5 becomes stabilized, and when used with Canon EF &amp; RF lenses that incorporate optical image stabilization technology, the camera’s built-in system works in conjunction to allow for an industry leading 8-stops of shake correction.nDeep learning AF technologynFace and eye AF technology is not new, but the EOS R5 is bringing the concept to a whole new level. The R5 utilizes a learning technology to locate a person’s head or eye when people detection is set, allowing for easier and more accurate subject tracking while shooting. Additionally, the R5 is incorporating animal detection for the first time in a Canon camera, which will allow the R5 to effectively track the body, face or eyes of cats, dogs or birds, regardless of the animal’s size, posture, or orientation of the face.n8K RAW videonThanks to the 45MP CMOS sensor, combined with the processing powerhouse of the DIGIC X, the R5 has the ability to record 8K movies, uncrossed, at up to 30 fps (29.97 fps). 4K video shooting up to 119.9 fps in 4:2:2 10-bit Canon Log, with Dual Pixel CMOS AF is also available in all 8K and 4K video modes. Internal recording is now available thanks to the use of CFexpress memory cards, eliminating the need for expensive external recorders.nUnparalleled durabilitynIn spite of its lightweight and comfortable design, the EOS R5 is built to last. A rigid magnesium alloy chassis enhances body durability, while shielding the camera from electromagnetic radiation and heat. Internal seals in critical areas like buttons, terminal covers, battery compartment, and card slot cover allow the camera to work flawlessly in a variety of poor weather conditions, and a newly designed shutter, rated up to 500k cycles, provides years of shooting enjoyment.nn",,,taxable,,1,,,0,0,,,,,1,,,"2799,0",Cameras > Digital > Canon,Other Electronics,,,https://webmall-1.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/3131.webp,,,,,,,,,0,

Elevate 3 speakers bring out every detail of the sound, unencumbered and crystal clear. Unlike conventional speakers that use vibration-prone plastic cabinets, the Elevate 3’s dense wood cabinets suppress clarity-robbing resonances, resulting in clearer sound and stronger bass. Elevate 3 studio speakers contain powerful, three-inch woofers and crisp-sounding one-inch silk-dome tweeters that deliver full lows, clean highs and a precise stereo image. The internal amplifier is custom-designed and equalized to work perfectly with the Elevate 3’s drivers, for impressive impact and output capability. For ease of operation, the Elevate 3’s on/off/volume knob is conveniently located on the front panel of the right speaker. Packaged in stereo-matched sets, Elevate 3 studio speakers give you everything you need, all in one box.\n\nTIME-TESTED TECHNOLOGY  \nAlesis has been creating studio monitors for nearly a quarter century. In that time, we’ve learned a thing or two about optimizing sound and sonic clarity. Built using technology adopted from our award-winning Monitor One and M1Active professional studio monitors, Elevate 3 studio speakers are the perfect way to upgrade your computer or mobile device experience. Elevate 3 speakers leverage Alesis’ experience in designing studio loudspeakers by employing custom-designed components that reproduce sound accurately and naturally, regardless of the frequency content or volume.\n\nFLEXIBLE I/O  \nOn the rear panel is a pair of rugged RCA jacks, perfect for connecting mixers, interfaces, and other audio gear. A 1/8-inch headphones jack lets you defeat the speakers’ sound for private listening at any time. Connecting the speakers is easy, using just a standard 1/8-inch cable (included). Elevate 3 studio speakers are accurate and smooth, but if you need a little more low-end punch, a convenient bass-boost switch does the trick. If you need even more power and low-end extension, Elevate 3 features a subwoofer output compatible with virtually any outboard powered subwoofer. Trust your sound to the clarity, precise design and premium performance of Alesis Elevate 3 studio speakers.\n\nFEATURES  \n• Perfect for home studios, video-editing, gaming and mobile devices  \n• Separate high- and low-frequency drivers with crossover  \n• 3-inch low-frequency driver in ported enclosure delivers rich, tight bass  \n• 1-inch silk dome tweeter provides smooth, clear highs  \n• 10W per channel output power; 20W total  \n• High-density wood cabinets suppress unwanted resonances  \n• Elliptical tweeter waveguide optimizes dispersion and stereo imaging  \n• Carefully formed baffle radiuses reduce edge diffraction  \n• Dedicated subwoofer output for use with virtually any powered subwoofer\n\nCONTENTS  \n• Elevate 3 MKII Speakers (Stereo Pair)  \n• RCA-to-1/8” (3.5mm) Audio Cable  \n• 1/8” (3.5mm) Interconnection Cable  \n• Power Cable  \n• Quickstart Guide  \n• Safety &amp; Warranty Manual",,,taxable,,1,,,0,0,,,,,1,,,"181,06",Peripherals > Speakers,PC Peripherals,,,https://webmall-1.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/bestsound.co_.za_7.jpg,,,,,,,,,0,

It is the latest addition to the BeagleBoard family.","BeagleBone Black is the newest member of the BeagleBoard family and is a lower-cost, high-expansion focused BeagleBone, featuring the Sitara AM3358BZCZ100 ARM Cortex-A8 32-Bit RISC microprocessor from Texas Instruments. It is similar to the BeagleBone but with some previous features removed to make way for the excellent new features. The Beagleboard.org platform has a proven track record of facilitating innovation from concept to market and BeagleBone Black’s enhanced feature set enables developers to turn ideas into prototypes more easily than ever. Whether operating standalone or in conjunction with another computer, this new BeagleBone will provide developers easy access to industry standard interfaces and a well-developed ecosystem of software and tools. If you liked the BeagleBone Black Rev B, you will love the Rev C! The Rev C still has a blistering 1 GHz processor and 512 MB onboard DDR3 RAM and like the old one, it has an AM3359 microprocessor, two 46-pin headers, micro HDMI for audio/video output, USB ports, 10/100 Ethernet and other I/O features. The Rev C is an ultra-powered embedded computer that can fit in a mint tin. This model includes 4 GB of eMMC built-in storage instead of the Rev B’s 2 GB. With the doubled storage and faster eMMC, the developers were able to make the Rev C’s most significant change: shipping the BeagleBone Black with Debian Linux pre-loaded on the board’s flash instead of Angstrom Linux. Debian Linux is a more user-friendly operating system than Angstrom and the switch to Debian is partly the result of consumer demand (especially from Adafruit users, thanks!) Of course, the BeagleBone Black Rev C is an open board so if you want to load it back up with Angstrom or other Linux-based distributions like Ubuntu or Android, you can.

2959,simple,,,Musical Fidelity V90-BLU5 HD Hi-Resolution Bluetooth Receiver Silver,1,0,visible,"The V90-BLU5 HD is a sophisticated Bluetooth receiver designed for streaming Hi-Res music formats from smartphones, tablets, Macs, and PCs directly to your favorite Hi-Fi system.","The V90-BLU5 HD is a sophisticated Bluetooth receiver ideal for streaming Hi-Res music formats from smartphones, tablets, MACs and PCs right to your favourite HiFi system. It comes with an improved Bluetooth 5.0 standard for increased range and transmission bandwidth and aptX HD support. Compared to the majority of Bluetooth receivers that use the integrated DAC on the Bluetooth chip itself, the V90-BLU5 HD goes the true high-end way. It is using a separate DAC with re-clocking and up-sampling, based on the first-class Burr-Brown chip PCM1781D. Bluetooth has never sounded this good, and you will finally have the proper integration for high-end systems, where Bluetooth is used for serious listening. Retain all the warmth, detail, transparency and dynamics in your music, which is unfortunately so often missing in other Bluetooth implementations.\n\nFEATURES:\n• High-Tech Bluetooth Streamer with special DAC and SRC\n• Design for complete High-End Bluetooth Playback\n• Bluetooth 5.0: more available bandwidth and transmission range\n• AptX HD for wireless High-Resolution Bluetooth transmission\n• Separate High-End DAC and SRC Circuit Design with Re-Clocking and Up-Sampling\n• Input Extender with Flexible Input and Output Options\n• Easy to integrate in any existing HiFi Setup\n• Burr-Brown PCM 1781D 24/192 Internal DAC\n\nThe big majority of Bluetooth receivers are using digital-to-analogue converters which are directly built-in on the Bluetooth chip. These are mostly of mediocre quality, because what they were designed for - a hands-free car phone system or small handheld mobile speakers - there is no need for parameters which will suit the requirements of high-end audio. Their low quality negatively influences the sound. V90 BLU5 HD is using a separate DAC, based on the first-class Burr-Brown chip PCM1781D. The digital signal from the Bluetooth receiver is re-clocked and up-sampled. And after that is processed by the D/A converter.\n\nSamplerate Converter SRC4392\nA high-end sample rate converter from Burr Brown, its task is to re-clock all signals and convert them into 24 bits and 192 kHz. Up-sampling done in this sophisticated and clean implementation allows us to reach the lowest distortion levels and maintain and elevate the integrity of your wireless Bluetooth audio.\n\nQualcomm CSR8670 Bluetooth Chip\nThe majority of Bluetooth receivers use standard “hands-free” chips. The V90 BLU5 HD has a HiFi audio-oriented chip from leading manufacturer Qualcomm. CSR8670 is a premium-tier product, designed to deliver high quality wireless audio performance and support the development of highly differentiated, premium wireless audio products. CSR8670 even has a relatively high-quality onboard DAC - also with 24/192 capability. After extensive listening tests however, we saw that we could do better and designed and built our own digital section consisting of a separate SRC and DAC in typical Musical Fidelity fashion. The result was worth it, because we have probably made the finest Bluetooth receiver on the market!\n\nV90 BLU 5 HD is using the latest Bluetooth standard 5.0\nBluetooth 5.0 is the latest version of the Bluetooth wireless communication standard. It includes various improvements, but only when used with compatible peripherals. We were able to push the range of the Bluetooth connection all the way to 240 metres (compared to 30 metres in Bluetooth 2.0). Even with obstacles and walls in the way, we can access more bandwidth allowing us to ensure constant high bit-rates for your aptX HD transmission. Of course, this requires a mobile device that also supports these standards. Should you have an older phone without BT 5.0, the standard will still be fully backwards compatible and just fall back to previous BT versions, albeit with taking hits in range and bandwidth.\n\nAptX HD\nV90 BLU5 HD is equipped with aptX HD. It was designed to answer the growing demand for high resolution audio. This enhanced codec supports 24-bit, high-resolution formats over Bluetooth. For aptX HD to work, your mobile device needs to supports it too. With careful engineering and expert circuit board design we could improve the signal-to-noise ratio, resulting in lower background noise. Lower THD and no audible artefacts ensure you can enjoy your music with hardly any interference. This means, we can now enable you hear even the smallest details in your music with punchy dynamics and transient detail on a real high-end level.\n\nFlexible Input Extender\nThe V90 BLU5 HD can be integrated into any audio system, even if there are no free inputs left. It will bypass the analogue RCA-in to its analogue out and digital-ins to its digital outs. Then, whenever you play a Bluetooth source, the V90 will automatically detect and play that signal instead. If a free input is available, then the V90 can be connected in the more traditional way and expand your range of inputs via its own analogue or digital inputs. We have also built in digital outputs, should you ever wish to feed your Bluetooth source to a different DAC.\n\nSpecifications\n\nBluetooth Performance\n• CSR8670 Bluetooth Chip\n• Bluetooth Radio Specification v5.0\n• SBC, Qualcomm® aptX™, aptX™ HD\n• aptX™ HD max. 24bit/96kHz; 576kbit/s\n• Carrier frequency 2.402 to 2.480 GHz\n• Transmission power +10dBm (max)\n• Class 5 up to 240M range\n• Class 2 up to 30M range\n\nDAC Section\n• Burr-Brown PCM 1781D 24/192 DAC\n• Burr-Brown SRC4392 Re-Clocking and Up-Sampling Chip\n\nTHD(+ noise):",,,taxable,,1,,,0,0,,,,,1,,,"480,0",Electronics,Other Electronics,,,https://webmall-1.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/klappav.com_.au_62.jpg,,,,,,,,,0,

2993,simple,,,Server RAM 4GB PC2-5300P ECC REG DDR2 667 PC5300 Memory FITS Dell HP IBM,1,0,visible,"The key difference between DDR2 and DDR SDRAM is the increased prefetch length. DDR SDRAM has a prefetch length of two bits per bit in a word, while DDR2 increases this length for improved performance.","The key difference between DDR2 and DDR SDRAM is the increase in prefetch length. In DDR SDRAM, the prefetch length was two bits for every bit in a word; whereas it is four bits in DDR2 SDRAM. During an access, four bits were read or written to or from a four-bit-deep prefetch queue. This queue received or transmitted its data over the data bus in two data bus clock cycles (each clock cycle transferred two bits of data). Increasing the prefetch length allowed DDR2 SDRAM to double the rate at which data could be transferred over the data bus without a corresponding doubling in the rate at which the DRAM array could be accessed. DDR2 SDRAM was designed with such a scheme to avoid an excessive increase in power consumption. DDR2's bus frequency is boosted by electrical interface improvements, on-die termination, prefetch buffers and off-chip drivers. However, latency is greatly increased as a trade-off. The DDR2 prefetch buffer is four bits deep, whereas it is two bits deep for DDR. While DDR SDRAM has typical read latencies of between two and three bus cycles, DDR2 may have read latencies between three and nine cycles, although the typical range is between four and six. Thus, DDR2 memory must be operated at twice the data rate to achieve the same latency. Another cost of the increased bandwidth is the requirement that the chips are packaged in a more expensive and difficult to assemble BGA package as compared to the TSSOP package of the previous memory generations such as DDR SDRAM and SDR SDRAM. This packaging change was necessary to maintain signal integrity at higher bus speeds. Power savings are achieved primarily due to an improved manufacturing process through die shrinkage, resulting in a drop in operating voltage (1.8 V compared to DDR's 2.5 V). The lower memory clock frequency may also enable power reductions in applications that do not require the highest available data rates. According to JEDEC[3] the maximum recommended voltage is 1.9 volts and should be considered the absolute maximum when memory stability is an issue (such as in servers or other mission critical devices). In addition, JEDEC states that memory modules must withstand up to 2.3 volts before incurring permanent damage (although they may not actually function correctly at that level).\n\nSamsung 4GB DDR2-667 PC2-5300P ECC Registered Server Memory M393T5160QZA-CE6  \n1 x 4Gb Memory, P/N: 2Rx4 PC2-5300P-555-12-L0  \nModel: 393T5160QZA-CE6  \nUnit is a working pull from a HP server",,,taxable,,1,,,0,0,,,,,1,,,"8,18",Memory,PC Components,,,https://webmall-1.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/pcoverstock.com_198.png,,,,,,,,,0,

Despite its compact size at only 4.4"" in width, the camera manages to incorporate a large 1"" High-Sensitivity MOS sensor and a Leica 15x optical zoom lens for shooting high quality 20.1MP photos. Complementing the sensor is a Venus Engine image processor capable of UHD 4K video recording at up to 30 fps and with an extended ISO of 25600 for use in low-light situations. The Leica DC Vario-Elmar lens incorporated in this camera has a 24-360mm equivalent focal length range that can cover a wide variety of situations. In the video department, a High-Speed mode allows the ZS200D to record Full HD 120 fps footage and play it back at 30 fps, resulting in instant slow-motion video. Also available is a 4K Photo Mode that uses the camera's video capabilities to generate 8 MP pictures at 30 fps; regular burst shooting at higher resolutions can reach 10 fps in AF-S and 6 fps in AF-C, thanks to a fast depth-from-defocus (DFD) focusing system. Finally, a 5-axis Hybrid O.I.S image stabilization system is present in all modes except for 4K and high-speed video recording, and helps minimize the appearance of camera shake for sharper imaging.\n\nThe ZS200D is also characterized by its intuitive physical design, with both an electronic viewfinder and a rear OLED screen available. The Live View Finder is a 0.21"" 2330k-Dot EVF that allows for comfortable eye-level monitoring, while the large 3.0"" OLED touchscreen is best-suited for image review, menu navigation, and live view shooting. Additional features include in-camera raw file processing, L-monochrome mode for black and white pictures, and Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity.\n\n20.1MP 1"" MOS Sensor and Venus Engine  \nA large 1"" 20.1MP High-Sensitivity MOS sensor pairs with a Venus Engine image processor to realize rich image quality with reduced noise and high sensitivity to an expanded ISO 25600. The sensor and processor combination also avails continuous shooting rates of 10 fps with single-shot AF, 6 fps with continuous AF, or 30 fps at 8MP in the 4K photo burst mode.\n\nLeica DC Vario-Elmar 15x Zoom Lens  \nA long-reaching 15x Leica DC Vario-Elmar zoom offers a 24-360mm equivalent focal length range along with a maximum aperture range of f/3.3-6.4. The lens construction incorporates three ED elements, five aspherical elements, and one aspherical ED lens to minimize spherical aberrations and distortions throughout the zoom range for increased image clarity and sharpness.  \nBenefitting the reach of the lens is a powerful 5-axis Hybrid O.I.S. system that compensates for a variety of camera movements for sharper handheld shooting in difficult lighting conditions. This image stabilization system also enables a unique Level Shot function that automatically detects the horizontal line of the recording image and keeps it level during shooting, regardless of camera tilt, helping to achieve greater shooting stability.\n\n4K Video and Photo Modes  \nThe sensor and processor combination also enables 4K video recording at both 30p and 24p frame rates in the MP4 format at 100 Mb/s. Full HD 1080p and HD 720p recording is also possible, as well as high-speed Full HD recording with 120 fps slow-motion playback.  \nBesides video, the 4K capabilities also permit recording 8MP stills at 30 fps in a trio of ways:  \n• 4K Burst: Just as with video recording, this mode will allow you to continuously record 8MP images at 30 fps for up to 15 minutes, making it ideal for instances where you need a fast frame rate in order to capture the best moment.  \n• 4K Pre-Burst: This mode is ideal for times when you're unsure of the critical moment to press the shutter button and will record 8MP images at 30 fps one second prior to and one second after pressing the shutter button in order to give you 60 frames to choose from.  \n• 4K Burst (S/S): This mode most closely follows the 4K video recording process, and allows you to playback your video, pause at the chosen moment, and use the shutter button to mark a chosen frame from the video and save it as a single 8MP frame.\n\nPost Focus and Light Speed AF  \nAnother attribute of the 4K capabilities is a unique focusing method called Post Focus. Working in conjunction with the 49-area contrast-detection focusing system, called Light Speed AF, and the intelligent Depth from Defocus (DFD) technology, Post Focus records imagery as a 4K MP4 file at 30 fps and shifts the specific point of focus throughout the burst shooting in order to offer a range of distinct focusing ranges to choose from. During playback, via the camera's touchscreen, you can then tap the specific region of the image you wish to be in focus and an 8MP JPEG file will be created. Multiple individual files with different points of focus can be created from the original burst, and focusing assist functions can also be used to gain even more precise control over the specific in-focus region.\n\nLive View Finder and Rear OLED Touchscreen  \nA Live View Finder (LVF) is integrated into the sleek body design to permit comfortable eye-level monitoring. This 0.21"" electronic viewfinder has a 2330k-dot resolution and covers 100% of the image frame while shooting.  \nAlternatively, a rear 3.0"" OLED monitor is also available for live-view shooting, image review, and intuitive menu navigation. Intuitive touch controls allow you to set focus on the subject simply by touching the screen, as well as release the shutter.\n\nOther Features  \nBuilt-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth allow you to wirelessly send photos and movies to linked smartphones and tablets for direct sharing online.  \n4K Photo Auto Marking automatically detects motion on a subject's face and sets a marker, allowing you to quickly skip to that sequence when selecting shots.  \nL.Monochrome mode in Photo Style simulates black and white film, creating impressive monochrome pictures with deep blacks and rich gradations.  \nIn-camera raw file processing is possible, allowing you to adjust color space, white balance, exposure compensation, highlights/shadows, saturation, noise reduction, sharpness, and many other settings.  \nThe included rechargeable lithium-ion battery provides you with 350 pictures with the electronic viewfinder when set to the eco30fps setting.",,,taxable,,1,,,0,0,,,,,1,,,"635,17",Cameras > Digital,Other Electronics,,,https://webmall-1.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/procam.com_371.jpg,,,,,,,,,0,

3405,simple,,,Sony ZV-E10 Mirrorless Camera with 16-50mm Lens (Black),1,0,visible,"Perfect for vloggers, this camera combines a large APS-C sensor and mirrorless versatility with features designed specifically for content creators.","Perfect for vloggers, the Sony ZV-E10 pairs a large APS-C sensor and mirrorless versatility with a specialized feature-set built just for content creators. Improving upon the ubiquitous smartphone, the ZV-E10 is an Alpha camera that brings improved image quality, greater choice of lenses, and increased control to up your creativity when shooting. Taking a concept that originated with the ZV-1, the ZV-E10 is the mirrorless continuation of this idea of a camera built around the concept of vlogging. It's a highly capable and portable camera but incorporates a series of design choices and shooting modes that are ideal for single-person productions. A vari-angle screen lets you accurately frame up shots, the integrated directional mic is purpose-built for recording more accurate sound from front-facing subjects, and shooting modes like Background Defocus and Product Showcase help you highlight specific subjects with ease.\n\nIn terms of specs, the ZV-E10 revolves around a 24.2MP APS-C Exmor CMOS sensor, which enables UHD 4K video recording up to 30p, Full HD recording at 120p, and stills shooting up to 11 fps. Sensitivity ranges from 100-32000 for working in a variety of lighting conditions and the sensor's design also integrates a 425-point Fast Hybrid AF system for accurate tracking and detection of subjects.\n\nThe body design is reminiscent of Sony's other Alpha E-mount cameras and features an intuitive control layout along with the functional 3.0"" vari-angle touchscreen LCD for intuitive settings control and framing. With audio being a main concern of vlogging and creative content, the ZV-E10 focuses on this aspect of recording by including a 3-capsule directional mic into the camera design as well as incorporating both 3.5mm mic and headphone ports and having the top Multi Interface shoe support a digital audio interface for improved audio quality.\n\nVlogging Features\n\nOptimized Camera Design  \nRear 3.0"" 921.6k-dot touchscreen LCD features a side flip-out design that is ideal for filming yourself or taking selfies in a natural and intuitive manner.  \nSide-opening screen allows for a redesigned top plate, which incorporates a directional 3-capsule microphone that is specifically designed for forward-directional audio recording. Also, a dedicated wind screen for the built-in mic is included to help achieve cleaner audio when working outdoors.  \nBoth 3.5mm microphone and headphone ports are also featured for more advanced audio recording, and the Multi Interface Shoe also benefits audio recording capabilities. This accessory shoe supports a digital audio interface that helps to achieve lower noise during recording and also eliminates cable clutter and the need for external power when working with compatible shoe-mounted mics.  \nFront tally lamp serves as a visual indicator for when recording is occurring. Also, the LCD can display a red border frame to further serve as an additional recording indicator.  \nLive streaming is possible directly from the camera simply by connecting the camera to a computer or compatible mobile device via USB, allowing the camera's video and audio capabilities to be used for live social media and video conferencing. UVC and UAC standards are supported for improved picture and sound quality during streaming.\n\nSpecialized Shooting Modes  \nProduct Showcase setting is ideal for vlogging and product review or demonstration videos and allows for quick and smooth focus transitions between a subject's face and an object placed in front of the lens.  \nBackground Defocus lets you immediately switch to the maximum aperture setting of the attached lens, using a custom button function, for isolating your subject using shallow depth of field and bokeh.  \nFace-Priority AE detects the subject's face and adjusts the exposure to ensure the face is depicted in an ideal brightness, even if walking from a bright place into shade. The AE technology also suppresses abrupt changes in exposure if the subject quickly turns away from the frame to eliminate unexpected blown-out or extremely dark shots.  \nRefined color science helps to optimize skin tones for any subject, in both still and video modes, in order to achieve a healthy and natural look that is inclusive of different ages, genders, and ethnicity.  \nSoft Skin Effect can be used to soften and smooth wrinkles or blemishes on a subject's face to create a natural, smooth complexion. The default setting is Mid and can be adjusted to Off, Low, or Hi. For longer takes, extended continuous video recording is available when setting the Auto Power OFF Temp. function to High.  \nMovie footage can be tagged with specific metadata to indicate vertical recording orientation for direct playback in smartphone apps or for other instances when vertical video playback is needed.  \nActive SteadyShot is an advanced image stabilization mode that ensures steady video while moving, even when handheld shooting while walking.\n\nImage Quality, Autofocus, and 4K Video\n\n24.2MP APS-C Exmor CMOS Sensor and BIONZ X Processor  \nA revised APS-C-format 24.2MP Exmor CMOS sensor realizes smooth, nuanced image quality with minimal noise and high sensitivity from ISO 100-32000, which can further be expanded to ISO 51200 for working in low-light conditions.  \nThe sensor dimensions are approximately 3x larger than a 1"" sensor, and up to 10x larger than some smartphone sensors, enabling greater sensitivity, reduced noise, and improved control over depth of field.  \nThe sensor and BIONZ X processor combination also avails a top continuous-shooting rate of 11 fps with AF and AE and permits 14-bit raw file output for a wide tonal and color scale.\n\n425-Point Fast Hybrid AF  \nThe sensor's design incorporates a 425-point Fast Hybrid AF system, which blends both phase-detection and contrast-detection methods to achieve focusing performance that is fast, natural, and accurate.  \nThe on-chip focusing system covers 84% of the sensor field and is capable of achieving focus in as little as 0.02 sec.  \nReal-time Eye AF can prioritize focusing on human or animal eyes for ensured sharpness when making portraits. When selected, this function is activated by half-pressing the shutter button and you can further choose to prioritize either the right or left eye.  \nReal-time tracking utilizes AI-based algorithms to automatically recognize and track moving subjects. If Face/Eye Priority AF is on, this tracking method will further track a subject's eye or face in real time with seamless changing depending on the status of the moving subject.\n\n4K Video Recording  \nUHD 4K video recording is possible up to 30p and uses full pixel readout with 6K oversampling to yield greater detail with reduced moiré and aliasing. Full HD 1080p recording is also supported in frame rates up to 120 fps, and both resolutions utilize the 100 Mb/s XAVC S format contained within an MP4 wrapper with 4:2:0 sampling. In addition to high-resolution internal recording, uncompressed HDMI output also enables the use of an optional external recorder for clean 4K recording with 4:2:2 sampling.  \nSlow &amp; Quick (S&amp;Q) mode allows shooters to capture Full HD video at specified steps between 1-120 fps. These settings will allow you to slow down action as well as speed up a slow-moving scene.  \nNo recording limit for movie recording, allowing for longer takes and uninterrupted shooting of live events.  \nAffording extensive customizable color and gamma controls, the ZV-E10 allows users to adjust the gamma, black level, knee, color level, and more. Use the same S-Log2 Gamma Curve that is found on high-end Sony Cinema cameras, which squeezes up to 1300% more dynamic range into the video signal then traditional Rec. 709, for increased post-production flexibility. HLG (Hybrid Log-Gamma) support is also available, along with the BT.2020 color space, for recording within a wide color gamut and, in addition to S-Log2, S-Log3 is also available for producing an effective 14-stop dynamic range with increased grading control in the shadow to mid-tone regions of the image.  \nInterval shooting mode is ideal for creating time-lapse movies with the aid of Imaging Edge software. Intervals can be selected between 1-60 seconds for recording up to 9999 sequential free. Also, in-camera battery charging is possible via the USB port using a portable battery to benefit long interval shooting sessions.\n\nPhysical Design and Wireless Connectivity\n\nCamera Body Design  \nBuilt for portable applications and one-handed use, the camera incorporates a large right-hand grip and intuitive physical control layout.  \nGrip design, along with the vari-angle LCD, also suits working from front-facing angles, such as when vlogging or taking selfies.  \nIntegrated zoom lever surrounds the shutter button and works in conjunction with select Power Zoom lenses.  \nVari-angle screen can be closed against the body, with the screen facing inward, to automatically power off the camera even when the power switch is set to 'On'.  \nDedicated Movie Record, Background Defocus, Product Showcase, and S&amp;Q buttons provide direct access to common features used by vloggers.  \nIncluded NP-FW50 battery is rated for up to 440 shots or approximately 125 minutes of recording per charge. Power can also be supplied to the camera through the USB Type-C port or by using the optional AC-PW20AM AC adapter.\n\nWireless and Sharing  \nBuilt-in Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity enables instant transferring of imagery to mobile devices for direct sharing online to social networking, via email, and to cloud storage sites. Once connected, the linked mobile device can also display a live view image on its screen and, using Smart Remote Control, remotely control the camera's shutter release.  \nThe ZV-E10 is also compatible with the Movie Edit add-on from the Imaging Edge mobile app.  \nBluetooth connectivity enables connecting to the optional GP-VPT2BT Wireless Shooting Grip for efficient camera control.\n\nE PZ 16-50mm f/3.5-5.6 OSS Lens  \nThe included E PZ 16-50mm f/3.5-5.6 OSS lens is a 24-75mm-equivalent zoom characterized by its versatile range and sleek, retractable design. Helping to deliver excellent optical quality throughout the range are an extra-low dispersion element and four aspherical elements to combat various aberrations and improve contrast. The lens also incorporates Optical SteadyShot image stabilization and a power zoom mechanism, both of which will help you capture smooth and steady stills and video. Additionally, it has an internal focus design, a minimum focus distance of 9.8"", and uses a seven-blade circular aperture for smooth bokeh.",,,taxable,,1,,,0,0,,,,,1,,,"726,18",Cameras > Digital > Sony,Other Electronics,,,https://webmall-1.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/procam.com_150.jpg,,,,,,,,,0,

For longer takes, extended continuous video recording is available when setting the Auto Power OFF Temp. function to High.  \n• Movie footage can be tagged with specific metadata to indicate vertical recording orientation for direct playback in smartphone apps or for other instances when vertical video playback is needed.  \n• Active SteadyShot is an advanced image stabilization mode that ensures steady video while moving, even when handheld shooting while walking.\n\nImage Quality, Autofocus, and 4K Video  \n24.2MP APS-C Exmor CMOS Sensor and BIONZ X Processor  \nA revised APS-C-format 24.2MP Exmor CMOS sensor realizes smooth, nuanced image quality with minimal noise and high sensitivity from ISO 100-32000, which can further be expanded to ISO 51200 for working in low-light conditions.  \nThe sensor dimensions are approximately 3x larger than a 1"" sensor, and up to 10x larger than some smartphone sensors, enabling greater sensitivity, reduced noise, and improved control over depth of field.  \nThe sensor and BIONZ X processor combination also avails a top continuous-shooting rate of 11 fps with AF and AE and permits 14-bit raw file output for a wide tonal and color scale.\n\n425-Point Fast Hybrid AF  \nThe sensor's design incorporates a 425-point Fast Hybrid AF system, which blends both phase-detection and contrast-detection methods to achieve focusing performance that is fast, natural, and accurate.  \nThe on-chip focusing system covers 84% of the sensor field and is capable of achieving focus in as little as 0.02 sec.  \nReal-time Eye AF can prioritize focusing on human or animal eyes for ensured sharpness when making portraits. When selected, this function is activated by half-pressing the shutter button and you can further choose to prioritize either the right or left eye.  \nReal-time tracking utilizes AI-based algorithms to automatically recognize and track moving subjects. If Face/Eye Priority AF is on, this tracking method will further track a subject's eye or face in real time with seamless changing depending on the status of the moving subject.\n\n4K Video Recording  \nUHD 4K video recording is possible up to 30p and uses full pixel readout with 6K oversampling to yield greater detail with reduced moiré and aliasing. Full HD 1080p recording is also supported in frame rates up to 120 fps, and both resolutions utilize the 100 Mb/s XAVC S format contained within an MP4 wrapper with 4:2:0 sampling. In addition to high-resolution internal recording, uncompressed HDMI output also enables the use of an optional external recorder for clean 4K recording with 4:2:2 sampling.  \nSlow &amp; Quick (S&amp;Q) mode allows shooters to capture Full HD video at specified steps between 1-120 fps. These settings will allow you to slow down action as well as speed up a slow-moving scene.  \nNo recording limit for movie recording, allowing for longer takes and uninterrupted shooting of live events.  \nAffording extensive customizable color and gamma controls, the ZV-E10 allows users to adjust the gamma, black level, knee, color level, and more. Use the same S-Log2 Gamma Curve that is found on high-end Sony Cinema cameras, which squeezes up to 1300% more dynamic range into the video signal then traditional Rec. 709, for increased post-production flexibility. HLG (Hybrid Log-Gamma) support is also available, along with the BT.2020 color space, for recording within a wide color gamut and, in addition to S-Log2, S-Log3 is also available for producing an effective 14-stop dynamic range with increased grading control in the shadow to mid-tone regions of the image.  \nInterval shooting mode is ideal for creating time-lapse movies with the aid of Imaging Edge software. Intervals can be selected between 1-60 seconds for recording up to 9999 sequential free. Also, in-camera battery charging is possible via the USB port using a portable battery to benefit long interval shooting sessions.\n\nPhysical Design and Wireless Connectivity  \nCamera Body Design  \nBuilt for portable applications and one-handed use, the camera incorporates a large right-hand grip and intuitive physical control layout.  \nGrip design, along with the vari-angle LCD, also suits working from front-facing angles, such as when vlogging or taking selfies.  \nIntegrated zoom lever surrounds the shutter button and works in conjunction with select Power Zoom lenses.  \nVari-angle screen can be closed against the body, with the screen facing inward, to automatically power off the camera even when the power switch is set to 'On'.  \nDedicated Movie Record, Background Defocus, Product Showcase, and S&amp;Q buttons provide direct access to common features used by vloggers.  \nIncluded NP-FW50 battery is rated for up to 440 shots or approximately 125 minutes of recording per charge. Power can also be supplied to the camera through the USB Type-C port or by using the optional AC-PW20AM AC adapter.\n\nWireless and Sharing  \nBuilt-in Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity enables instant transferring of imagery to mobile devices for direct sharing online to social networking, via email, and to cloud storage sites. Once connected, the linked mobile device can also display a live view image on its screen and, using Smart Remote Control, remotely control the camera's shutter release.  \nThe ZV-E10 is also compatible with the Movie Edit add-on from the Imaging Edge mobile app.  \nBluetooth connectivity enables connecting to the optional GP-VPT2BT Wireless Shooting Grip for efficient camera control.\n\nE PZ 16-50mm f/3.5-5.6 OSS Lens  \nThe included E PZ 16-50mm f/3.5-5.6 OSS lens is a 24-75mm-equivalent zoom characterized by its versatile range and sleek, retractable design. Helping to deliver excellent optical quality throughout the range are an extra-low dispersion element and four aspherical elements to combat various aberrations and improve contrast.

The Cisco Catalyst 9120AX Access Point features internal antennas, Wi-Fi 6, and 4x4:4 MIMO for enhanced performance and reliability.","Cisco C9120AXI-E\n\nWe are more dependent on our wireless networks than ever before. Additional devices connect to the network every year, and the Cisco Catalyst 9120AX Series Access Points will provide a seamless experience anywhere for everyone. Going beyond the Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) standard, the 9120AX Series provides integrated security, resiliency, and operational flexibility as well as increased network intelligence.\n\nExtending Cisco’s intent-based network and perfect for networks of all sizes, the Cisco Catalyst 9120AX Series scales to the growing demands of IoT while fully supporting the latest innovations and new technologies. Not only that, but the 9120AX Series is a leader in performance, security, and analytics.\n\nThe Cisco Catalyst 9120AX Series Access Points, paired with Cisco DNA, are enterprise-class products that will address your current and future needs. These access points are the first step in updating your network so that you can take better advantage of all of the features and benefits that Wi-Fi 6 provides.\n\nWi-Fi 6 (802.11ax)\n\nThe IEEE 802.11ax emerging standard, also known as High-Efficiency-Wireless (HEW) or Wi-Fi 6, builds on 802.11ac. It delivers a better experience in typical environments with more predictable performance for advanced applications such as 4K or 8K video, high-density, high-definition collaboration apps, all-wireless offices, and IoT. Wi-Fi 6 is designed to use both the 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz bands, unlike the 802.11ac standard.\n\nCisco RF ASIC\n\nCisco RF ASIC is a fully integrated Software-Defined Radio (SDR) that can perform advanced RF spectrum analysis and delivers features like Cisco CleanAir, Wireless Intrusion Prevention System (wIPS), Fast Locate*, and DFS detection.\n(*Future)\n\nUplink/downlink OFDMA\n\nOrthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access (OFDMA)-based scheduling splits the bandwidth into smaller chunks called Resource Units (RUs), which can be allocated to individual clients in both the downlink and uplink directions to reduce overhead and latency.\n\nMU‑MIMO technology\n\nSupporting four spatial streams, Multiuser Multiple Input, Multiple Output (MU-MIMO) enables access points to split spatial streams between client devices, to maximize throughput.\n\nBSS coloring\n\nSpatial reuse (also known as Basic Service Set [BSS] coloring) allows the access points and their clients to differentiate between BSSs, thus permitting more simultaneous transmissions.\n\nTarget wake timer\n\nA new power savings mode called Target Wake Time (TWT) allows the client to stay asleep and to wake up only at prescheduled (target) times to exchange data with the access point. This offers significant energy savings for battery-operated devices, up to three to four times greater compared to 802.11n and 802.11ac.\n\nIntelligent Capturer\n\nIntelligent Capture probes the network and provides Cisco DNA Center with deep analysis. The software can track over 240 anomalies and instantaneously review all packets on demand, emulating the onsite network administrator. Intelligent Capture allows for more informed decisions on your wireless networks.\n\nFlexible Radio Assignment\n\nAllows the access points to intelligently determine the operating mode of serving radios based on the RF environment. The access points can operate in the following modes:\n• 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz mode: One radio will serve clients in 2.4-GHz mode, while the other serves clients in 5-GHz mode.\n• Dual 5-GHz mode: Both radios inside the access point operate on the 5-GHz band, maximizing the benefits of Wi-Fi 6 and increasing client device capacity.\n\nDual 5-GHz radio support\n\nEnables both radios to operate in 5-GHz client serving mode, allowing an industry-leading 5.2 Gbps (2 x 2.6 Gbps) over-the-air speeds while increasing client capacity.\n\nSmart antenna connector\n\nAn intelligent second physical antenna connector is included on 9120AX Series access points with an external antenna. This connector provides advanced network design flexibility for high-density and large open-area environments such as auditoriums, convention centers, libraries, cafeterias, and arenas/stadiums, allowing two sets of antennas to be connected and active on a single access point.\n\nCisco Embedded Wireless Controller\n\nThe 9120AX Series Wi-Fi 6 access points is available with a built-in controller. The Cisco Embedded Wireless Controller on Catalyst 9100 Access Points provides an easy-to-deploy and manage option that does not require a physical appliance. The control resides on the access point so there is no added footprint or complexity. And, because it uses Cisco Catalyst 9800 Series code, it’s easy to migrate your network as your needs grow. For more details refer to the EWC data sheet.\n\nApplication Hosting on Catalyst 9100 Access\n\nApplication Hosting on Catalyst 9100 Access Points helps future-proof and simplify IoT deployments by eliminating the need to install and manage overlay networks. Utilizing the USB interface, containerized applications and hardware modules can be deployed to reduce cost and complexity. Adding Cisco DNA Center provides workflows and deployment-wide application lifecycle management.\n\nMultigigabit Ethernet support\n\nProvides uplink speeds of 2.5 Gbps, in addition to 100 Mbps and 1 Gbps. All speeds are supported on Category 5e cabling for an industry first, as well as 10GBASE-T (IEEE 802.3bz) cabling.\n\nBluetooth radio\n\nIntegrated Bluetooth Low Energy 5 radio to enable IoT use cases such as location tracking and wayfinding.\n\nContainer support for applications\n\nEnables edge computing capabilities for IoT applications on the host access point.\n\nApple features\n\nApple and Cisco have partnered to create an optimal mobile experience for iOS devices on corporate networks based on Cisco technologies. Using new features in iOS 10, in combination with the latest software and hardware from Cisco, businesses can now more effectively use their network infrastructure to deliver an enhanced user experience across all business applications.\n\nAt the center of the collaboration is a unique handshake between the Cisco WLAN and Apple devices. This handshake enables the Cisco WLAN to provide an optimal Wi-Fi roaming experience to Apple devices. Additionally, the Cisco WLAN trusts Apple devices and gives priority treatment for business-critical applications specified by the Apple device. This feature is also known as Fast Lane.",,,taxable,,1,,,0,0,,,,,1,,,"407,0",Access Points,Other Electronics,,,https://webmall-1.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/sunnymartinscomputers.com_51.jpg,,,,,,,,,0,
