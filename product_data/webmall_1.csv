1966,simple,,,"Canon EOS R5, RF 24-105mm f/4L IS USM",1,0,visible,,"Canon EOS R5, RF 24-105mm F/4L IS USMnnTHE EXPECTED DELIVERY DATE MAY VARY DUE TO PRODUCT AVAILABILITYnnnKey Featuresnnn45MP Full-Frame CMOS SensornDIGIC X Image Processorn8K30 Raw and 4K120 10-Bit Internal VideonSensor-Shift 5-Axis Image Stabilizationnn nnnnFor the professional image-maker who needs resolution, speed, and video capabilities, there is the Canon EOS R5. Setting a new standard for versatility, this full-frame mirrorless camera features a newly developed 45MP CMOS sensor, which offers 8K raw video recording, 12 fps continuous shooting with a mechanical shutter, and is the first EOS camera to feature 5-axis sensor-shift image stabilization.nBeyond just resolution, the sensor also pairs with the refined DIGIC X image processor to usher in a new generation of Dual Pixel CMOS AF for quick, smooth, and intelligent focusing performance using 1053 selectable points that cover the entire field of view. This focusing system has also been updated to make use of Deep Learning technology for improved subject tracking as well as precise eye, face, and head-detection for both people and animals.nComplementing the imaging assets, the R5, while sporting a new design, also feels familiar to EOS 5-series users. An especially high-resolution 5.76m-dot electronic viewfinder provides a realistic 120 fps refresh rate while the rear touchscreen LCD monitor sports a vari-angle design to accommodate vlogging needs as well as benefit working from high and low angles. A top status makes for an intuitive workflow and the camera also incorporates dual memory card slots—one CFexpress Type B, one SD UHS-II—along with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi wireless connectivity.nnnnnnnn45MP Full-Frame Sensor and DIGIC X ProcessornnBuilt around a newly developed 45MP full-frame CMOS sensor, the EOS R5 offers both high-resolution stills and video output and the fine-tuned DIGIC X image processor complements this with a wealth of speed. Sensitivity from ISO 100-51200, which can be expanded to ISO 102400, suits working in a variety of lighting conditions while quick continuous shooting up to 12 fps with a mechanical shutter, or silent 20 fps with an electronic shutter, is ideal for working with moving subjects.nnnnnn8K30 Raw and 4K120 Video RecordingnnBenefitting more than just stills, the 45MP full-frame sensor also enables impressively high-resolution DCI and UHD 8K 30 fps raw video recording internally along with 4K recording up to 120 fps in 4:2:2 10-bit with Canon Log. HDR-PQ recording is possible, too, in-camera HDR production and external recording, via the HDMI port supports a clean 4K output at up to 60 fps. Both All-I and IPB compression options are available, along with the ability to use Dual Pixel CMOS AF when shooting at up to 8K raw.nnnnnnDual Pixel CMOS AFnnAn updated Dual Pixel CMOS AF features 1053 selectable focusing points, which cover approximately 100% of the image frame for wide and even coverage. This focusing system offers smooth and fast focusing performance in a similar manner to how a camcorder acquires focus. This system integrates two separate photodiodes within each pixel to provide a broad and dense network of phase-detection gathering elements across a majority of the image sensor to reduce focus hunting for faster, more direct control of focus placement. When working with still imagery, this focusing system works to acquire focus quickly and accurately, making it ideally suited to shooting and tracking moving subjects so that critical focus is attained with each shot. When shooting video, a Movie Servo AF mode offers smooth and natural focusing when changing from different subjects or different distances within the scene, as well as the ability to specify tracking sensitivity, AF speed, and Face Tracking priority. Benefited by the Touch AF system, rack focus is possible simply by touching elements within the scene on the touchscreen in order to change focus in an intuitive manner. Subject tracking in movies is also heightened due to the Dual Pixel CMOS AF system's ability to recognize subjects and maintain focus when working within changing or cluttered scenery.Subject tracking has also been benefitted through the use of Deep Learning technology, which helps to gradually refine the focusing system's ability to quickly and accurately recognize both people and animal subjects. This technology also supports the more refined eye, face, and head detection functions, for both people and animals, that are well-suited for portraiture applications.nnnnnnSensor-Shift Image StabilizernnA first for EOS cameras, the R5 incorporates five-axis sensor-shift image stabilization that compensates for up to an impressive eight stops of camera shake for truly effective compensation of camera shake to suit handheld shooting with slower shutter speeds. This stabilization system also works in concert with lens-based optical image stabilization for both native RF lenses and adapted EF lenses.nnnnnnBody Design and Wireless ConnectivitynnnnHigh-resolution 5.67m-dot 0.5"" electronic viewfinder provides a bright and detailed means for eye-level viewing and the quick 120 fps refresh rate offers natural motion rendering for a more realistic viewfinder experience.nRear 3.2"" LCD touchscreen features a vari-angle design that benefits front-facing recording, such as for vlogging needs, as well as working from high and low shooting angles.nTop status LCD can be used to quickly review camera and shooting settings.nCFexpress Type B and SD UHS-II memory card slots are featured for flexible storage needs; the CFexpress slot is ideal for 8K video and high-speed, high-resolution burst shooting needs while the SD card slot retains a familiar form factor for wide compatibility.nBoth a 3.5mm headphone and a 3.5mm external microphone port are featured for improved audio monitoring and recording capabilities.nRefined body design incorporates four distinct control dials across the body for intuitive tactile control and a joystick controller is used on the back of the camera for fast and intuitive focus point selection and menu navigation.nDurable, weather-sealed body design is built to handle tough working conditions and inclement weather.nBoth 5 GHz and 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi bands are available for fast file transferring to a mobile device and Bluetooth is also available to provide constant device connection via the Canon Camera Connect app.nnnnnnnnRF 24-105mm f/4L IS USM LensnnIncluded with the camera body is the versatile RF 24-105mm f/4L IS USM lens; a standard zoom covering wide-angle to portrait-length focal lengths. Its f/4 constant maximum aperture maintains consistent performance throughout the zoom range and suits working in a variety of lighting conditions. An Image Stabilizer also suits photographing in low-light by compensating for the effects of camera shake to result in sharper imagery when shooting handheld. Benefitting both stills and video applications, it also has an Ultrasonic Motor that delivers quick, quiet, and precise autofocus performance along with full-time manual focus override.nnnnn",,,taxable,,1,,,0,0,,,,,1,,,"4000,0","Cameras > Digital > Canon",,,https://webmall-1.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/3129.jpg,,,,,,,,,0,,avcstore.com_823,3129,1,uag-css-1966.css,
1967,simple,,,"Canon EOS R5 Mirrorless Camera Body",1,0,visible,,"Building on the established legacy of Canon full frame cameras and the successful EOS R and RP mirrorless cameras, the Canon EOS R5 Mirrorless Digital Camera Body brings next-generation processing power, image quality, performance and build quality to the market. It’s the ideal camera for photographers and cinematographers who are looking for cutting-edge technology for anything from weddings, portraits, sports, landscape, high-end cinema, and more.nn  NEW FIRMWARE UPDATEnnnnnCutting-edge quality with an all-new 45MP CMOS sensornAt the heart of the EOS R5 is a newly developed, 45MP full frame CMOS sensor. The highest resolution mirrorless camera available from Canon, the R5 will excel when shooting even the most demanding of subjects. Thanks to this incredibly high resolution, the finest details will be realized, and photographers will have the ultimate flexibility with both enlarging their images, or cropping to realize creative vision expressed in post-processing.nDIGIC X image processornIf the 45MP CMOS sensor is the heart of the R5, the brain is undoubtedly the DIGIC X image processor. Originally introduced in the EOS 1D X Mark III DSLR, the DIGIC X processor allows an unbelievable ISO range of 100-51200. Thanks to this, shooting in less than ideal lighting conditions or with slower lenses is no longer a limitation. Expandable up to 10,400, the R5 will be able to capture detail and retain image quality in nearly any lighting environment thanks to the DIGIC X.nBigger files does not mean slower performancenUnlike previous high resolution digital cameras, the added resolution of the EOS R5 does not come at the expense of speed. Shooting speeds of up to 12 fps with the mechanical shutter, or 20 fps when shooting with the electronic silent shutter, allows photographers to capture split-second details among even the fastest-moving subjects. Whether it’s a snowboarder in the half pipe, or a bride assaulting her new hubby with the wedding cake, subjects will be captured in full detail, with autofocus keeping them tack-sharp throughout the shooting sequence.nIn-Body Image Stabilizer IBISnThe EOS R5 is Canon’s first camera to incorporate a 5-axis in-body image stabilization (IBIS). Thanks to this new system, any lens used on the EOS R5 becomes stabilized, and when used with Canon EF &amp; RF lenses that incorporate optical image stabilization technology, the camera’s built-in system works in conjunction to allow for an industry leading 8-stops of shake correction.nDeep learning AF technologynFace and eye AF technology is not new, but the EOS R5 is bringing the concept to a whole new level. The R5 utilizes a learning technology to locate a person’s head or eye when people detection is set, allowing for easier and more accurate subject tracking while shooting. Additionally, the R5 is incorporating animal detection for the first time in a Canon camera, which will allow the R5 to effectively track the body, face or eyes of cats, dogs or birds, regardless of the animal’s size, posture, or orientation of the face.n8K RAW videonThanks to the 45MP CMOS sensor, combined with the processing powerhouse of the DIGIC X, the R5 has the ability to record 8K movies, uncrossed, at up to 30 fps (29.97 fps). 4K video shooting up to 119.9 fps in 4:2:2 10-bit Canon Log, with Dual Pixel CMOS AF is also available in all 8K and 4K video modes. Internal recording is now available thanks to the use of CFexpress memory cards, eliminating the need for expensive external recorders.nUnparalleled durabilitynIn spite of its lightweight and comfortable design, the EOS R5 is built to last. A rigid magnesium alloy chassis enhances body durability, while shielding the camera from electromagnetic radiation and heat. Internal seals in critical areas like buttons, terminal covers, battery compartment, and card slot cover allow the camera to work flawlessly in a variety of poor weather conditions, and a newly designed shutter, rated up to 500k cycles, provides years of shooting enjoyment.nn",,,taxable,,1,,,0,0,,,,,1,,,"2799,0","Cameras > Digital > Canon",,,https://webmall-1.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/3131.webp,,,,,,,,,0,,pictureline.com_942,3131,1,uag-css-1967.css,
