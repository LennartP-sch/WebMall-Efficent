When switched in the other direction, it becomes a full-frame 8K 60p Cinema EOS camera that internally records 12-bit Cinema RAW Light footage. There's no more need to carry a second camera with you to your production when stills and video are available within a single compact design.n nThe R5 C enhances a number of features in comparison to its siblings the R5 and C70, including 4K120 recording, HDMI RAW output, Canon Log 3 HLG/PQ support, unlimited recording time, a timecode port, Dual Pixel CMOS AF with eye detection, an active cooling system, a high-power LP-E6NH battery, 13 reassignable buttons, and a multi-function shoe for XLR adapters. The camera also retains the reliable features of those cameras such as Wi-Fi/Bluetooth, footage compatibility with DaVinci Resolve and Canon apps, an electronic RF mount, CFexpress/SD card slots, a similar button layout, and more. The EOS R5 C is also moisture and dustproof to the same level as its cinema cousin, the EOS C70. And all this is packed into a tiny body that weighs just under 800 grams, that is just asking to become your go-to drone camera.nnTwo Cameras in One Body: Photo + Cineman45MP Stills, Full-Frame 8K CMOS SensornPhoto/Video Switch Changes Settings MenunJPEG/C-RAW, 12-Bit Cinema RAW LightnDual Pixel CMOS AF with Eye DetectionnCFexpress Type-B and SD UHS-II SlotsnDual-Slot Record, Unlimited Record TimenTimecode DIN Port, Multi-Function Shoen4-Channel Audio Record with XLR Adaptern13 Reassignable ButtonsnnIn the BoxnnCanon EOS R5 C Mirrorless Cinema CameranLP-E6NH Battery PacknLC-E6 Battery ChargernSS-1200 Shoulder StrapnIFC-100U Interface CablenCable ProtectornR-F-5 Camera Covernn",,,taxable,,1,,,0,0,,,,,1,,,"4238,0",Cameras > Canon > EOS R5 C,Other Electronics,,,https://webmall-4.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/3127.jpg,,,,,,,,,0,
1437,simple,,,"Canon EOS R5 Mark II Mirrorless Digital Camera, Body Only",1,0,visible,,"The EOS R5 Mark II is a worthy successor to the incredibly versatile EOS R5 bringing a host of new features that make this the most powerful EOS 5 series camera ever. It starts with a brand-new 45MP sensor that is back illuminated and stacked for blazingly fast read-out speeds that allow for a 30 fps electronic shutter, then builds on that with major focus improvements, increased video capabilities, and so much more.nDIGIC AcceleratorThe DIGIC Accelerator chip is a completely new front-end processor developed by Canon to supplement the power of the proven DIGIC X processor. The DIGIC Accelerator handles the processing that makes so many of the new features of this camera possible, allowing the DIGIC X chip to focus solely on image processing, again contributing to incredible speed. The DIGIC Accelerator processes large volumes of data directly from the image sensor for actions like AF detection to exposure metering calculations that enable eye-control focus, subject identification and tracking, and even deep learning with features like neural upscaling and noise reduction.nTotally new SensorEven though the pixel count is the same as the EOS R5, this is a completely new 45MP sensor design. This new full-frame sensor is stacked and back-illuminated allowing for incredible electronic shutter performance of 30 fps RAW or full-resolution JPEG still images. Sensor read-out speeds are dramatically increased, significantly reducing rolling shutter distortion. Pre-continuous shooting is now possible in electronic shutter mode, when the shutter is pressed halfway the camera begins capturing images, and when fully pressed, the previous ½-second of images are written to the memory card.nTime to focusAutofocus has been significantly updated on the EOS R5 Mark II with features like subject tracking which it shares with the new flagship EOS R1. Subject tracking allows you to maintain focus on a subject even when they are obscured briefly while shooting. And, for even faster positioning of your active AF Area, the R5 Mark II adds Canon’s EyenControl AF - even more advanced than the Eye Control in the EOS R3 camera. Once you calibrate the viewfinder to your eye, just look where you want to focus, and the AF Area will move there when you press the AF activation button.nAction priorityThanks again to the increased camera processing power of the DIGIC Accelerator chip, we have developed a new AF mode called Action priority. This new focusing technology selects subjects according to movement and other factors so you always get a great action shot! This feature works with three sports at the moment, soccer, volleyball, and basketball. With Action priority the camera can recognize and track specific people, and takes into account ball tracking, movement tracking, eye-control AF and more to help ensure you get the action shot you want when everything is moving so fast.nGet CinematicWith its 45MP sensor, 8K video up to 60 frames per second can be recorded internally, to the camera’s CFexpress card (sold separately). A new menu now includes Cinema EOSterminology, making it even easier for users to access and understand the video features of this camera, and be easily integrated into video productions where Cinema EOS cameras may be used like the EOS C70 or EOS C400. RAW video can be recorded at 8K resolution, and there’s now an S-RAW setting for 4K RAW video recording. RAW video is now 14-bit recording, for even greater range of tonalities. For users who don’t need RAW video, MP4-type video can be recorded in a multitude of possible file types and resolutions, from Full HD (at up to 240 frames per second), 4K at up to 120 framesper second with sound and 8K. Any of the “Fine” options record oversampled video, for even greater sharpness and detail. Canon Log 2 and C-Log 3 are available. And, the R5 Mark II adds features like a full-size HDMI port on the camera, Waveform monitors, and up to 24-bit, 4-channel audio recording.n",,,taxable,,1,,,0,0,,,,,1,,,"1399,0",Cameras > Canon > EOS R5 Mark II,Other Electronics,,,https://webmall-4.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/3128.jpg,,,,,,,,,0,

Get the performance you need, where you need it, whether you’re a gamer, creator, streamer, or everyday user. Whatever you’re into, do more of it, whenever you want with Intel® 12 Generation processors. With unprecedented new performance hybrid architecture, 12th Gen Intel® Core™ processors offer a unique combination of Performance and Efficient-cores (P-core and E-core). That means real-world performance, intuitively scaled to match whatever you’re doing. The Performance-core is Intel’s highest-performing CPU core ever. And it’s designed to maximize single-thread performance and responsiveness for compute-intensive workloads like gaming and 3D design. The Efficient-core delivers multithreaded performance for tasks that can run in parallel (like image rendering), along with efficient offload of background tasks for modern multitasking. So that Performance-cores and Efficient-cores can work seamlessly with the operating system, Intel built Intel® Thread Director right into the hardware. Automatically monitoring and analyzing on-the-fly, Intel® Thread Director guides the operating system, helping it place the right thread on the right core, at the right time. And it does it all dynamically, adapting scheduling guidance based on actual computing needs, not on static rules. 12th Gen Intel® Core™ processors also support the next wave of discrete graphics cards and storage devices. These devices take advantage of increased throughput coming with PCIe 5.0 as well the higher speeds and bandwidth of DDR5 memory. With 12th Gen Intel® Core™ processors, standard, built-in features enable capabilities like noise suppression, auto-framing, and optimization for bandwidth and video resolution while gaming. That saves you time and lets you multitask in ways you’ve only ever dreamed of, until now. From epic gaming to browsing to streaming to creating your next masterpiece, 12th Gen Intel® Core™ processors make it all entirely doable.\n\nFEATURES:\n• 6 Cores\n• 12 Threads\n• Max Turbo Frequency of up to 4.40GHz\n• 18MB Intel® Smart Cache\n• Support for DDR4 and DDR5 memory\n• Built for serious gaming\n• Smart solutions for enthusiasts and creators\n• Nearly 3x faster connectivity\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\nEssentials:\nProduct Collection: 12th Generation Intel® Core™ i5 Processors  \nCode Name: Products formerly Alder Lake  \nVertical Segment: Desktop  \nProcessor Number: i5-12400  \n\nCPU Specifications:\nTotal Cores: 6  \n# of Performance-cores: 6  \n# of Efficient-cores: 0  \nTotal Threads: 12  \nMax Turbo Frequency: 4.40 GHz  \nPerformance-core Max Turbo Frequency: 4.40 GHz  \nPerformance-core Base Frequency: 2.50 GHz  \nCache: 18 MB Intel® Smart Cache  \nTotal L2 Cache: 7.5 MB  \nProcessor Base Power: 65 W  \nMaximum Turbo Power: 117 W  \n\nMemory Specifications:\nMax Memory Size (dependent on memory type): 128 GB  \nMemory Types: Up to DDR5 4800 MT/s, Up to DDR4 3200 MT/s  \nMax # of Memory Channels: 2  \nMax Memory Bandwidth: 76.8 GB/s  \n\nProcessor Graphics:\nProcessor Graphics: Intel® UHD Graphics 730  \nGraphics Base Frequency: 300 MHz  \nGraphics Max Dynamic Frequency: 1.45 GHz  \nGraphics Output: eDP 1.4b, DP 1.4a, HDMI 2.1  \nExecution Units: 24  \nMax Resolution (HDMI): 4096 x 2160 @ 60Hz  \nMax Resolution (DP): 7680 x 4320 @ 60Hz  \nMax Resolution (eDP - Integrated Flat Panel): 5120 x 3200 @ 120Hz  \nDirectX Support: 12  \nOpenGL Support: 4.5  \nMulti-Format Codec Engines: 1  \nIntel® Quick Sync Video: Yes  \nIntel® Clear Video HD Technology: Yes  \n# of Displays Supported: 4  \nDevice ID: 0x4692 / 0x4682  \nOpenCL Support: 2.1  \n\nExpansion Options:\nDirect Media Interface (DMI) Revision: 4.0  \nMax # of DMI Lanes: 8  \nScalability: 1S Only  \nPCI Express Revision: 5.0 and 4.0  \nPCI Express Configurations: Up to 1×16+4, 2×8+4  \nMax # of PCI Express Lanes: 20  \n\nAdvanced Features:\nIntel® Gaussian &amp; Neural Accelerator: 3.0  \nIntel® Thread Director: No  \nIntel® Deep Learning Boost (Intel® DL Boost): Yes  \nIntel® Optane™ Memory Supported: Yes  \nIntel® Speed Shift Technology: Yes  \nIntel® Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0: No  \nIntel® Turbo Boost Technology: 2.0  \nIntel® Hyper-Threading Technology: Yes  \nIntel® Virtualization Technology (VT-x): Yes  \nIntel® Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O (VT-d): Yes  \nIntel® VT-x with Extended Page Tables (EPT): Yes  \nIntel® 64: Yes  \nInstruction Set: 64-bit  \nInstruction Set Extensions: Intel® SSE4.1, Intel® SSE4.2, Intel® AVX2  \nIdle States: Yes  \nEnhanced Intel SpeedStep® Technology: Yes  \nThermal Monitoring Technologies: Yes  \nIntel® Volume Management Device (VMD): Yes  \n\nSecurity &amp; Reliability:\nIntel® AES New Instructions: Yes  \nSecure Key: Yes  \nIntel® OS Guard: Yes  \nExecute Disable Bit: Yes  \nIntel® Boot Guard: Yes  \nMode-based Execute Control (MBE): Yes  \nIntel® Control-Flow Enforcement Technology: Yes  \n\nWHAT’S IN THE BOX:\nIntel 12th Gen Core i5-12400 LGA1700 2.5GHz 6-Core CPU x1",,,taxable,,1,,,0,0,,,,,1,,,"185,43",Processors,PC Components,,,https://webmall-4.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/t-labz.com_121.jpg,,,,,,,,,0,

\nOverclocking overhead is limited by operating temperature. The unique design of the VENGEANCE LPX heat spreader optimally pulls heat away from the ICs and into your system’s cooling path, so you can push it harder.
\n
\nDesigned For High-Performance Overclocking
\nEach VENGEANCE LPX module is built from a custom performance PCB and highly-screened memory ICs. The efficient heat spreader provides effective cooling to improve overclocking potential.
\n
\nLow-Profile Design
\nThe small form factor makes it ideal for smaller cases or any system where internal space is at a premium.
\n
\nMatch Your System
\nThe best high-performance systems look as good as they run. VENGEANCE LPX is available in several colors to match your motherboard, your other components, your case -- or just your favorite color.
\n

With the same area, more bank groups can be packed into the module, doubling what was possible with DDR4, giving you higher capacities.  \n\n• Improved Stability  \nWith error correcting code (ECC) this module can correct errors automatically in real-time. In addition to greatly reducing the burden of CPU calculations, it also provides increased stability and reliability for enterprise-class computers.  \n\n• QuikTips: DDR5 vs DDR4 - Appearance  \nDDR5 U-DIMM modules have the same dimensions and pin count as DDR4 modules. The most obvious difference is the position of the fool-proof notch. Also, DDR5 integrates I/O resistors with CMD/ADD resistors. Also, the appearance of DDR5 modules are cleaner than DDR4. In addition, you can see a PMIC in the center.  \n\n• QuikTips: DDR5 vs DDR4 - Chip Architecture  \nDDR5 modules provide two times more capacity than DDR4 by packing in more banks and bank groups. In addition, Burst Length, Prefetch are also doubled, increasing the number of data writes and the amount of data taken upfront. And to ensure data integrity, they feature error correcting code (ECC) technology.  \n\n• QuikTips: DDR5 vs DDR4 - Performance  \nThe biggest change is that bandwidth and frequency are significantly higher. The ADATA DDR5 memory modules deliver frequencies of up to 4800MT/s and feature bandwidth of 38.4GB/s, which is 50% higher than the DDR4-3200.

The red and white connectors are for audio (right and left channels, respectively), while the yellow connector is for composite video.\n• Verify the TV or display settings: Ensure that your TV or display is set to the correct input or source channel corresponding to the RCA inputs used for the PlayStation AV Cable. This may be labeled as ""AV,"" ""Composite,"" ""Video,"" or something similar.\n• Check your TV or display's aspect ratio and resolution settings, as they may affect the video quality.\n• Inspect the cable for damage: Carefully examine the PlayStation AV Cable for any signs of damage, such as cuts, fraying, or kinks, which could cause a loss of audio or video signal or intermittent connections.\n• Check the AV Multi Out connector and RCA connectors for signs of wear, bent pins, or foreign objects that may prevent a proper connection.\n• Test the connected devices: If possible, test your PlayStation console with an alternative AV cable or a different connection method (such as an HDMI cable, if supported) to rule out any issues with the original AV cable.\n• Similarly, try connecting another device, like a DVD player or another game console, using the same AV cable and RCA inputs on your TV or display to verify that the problem is not with the TV or display itself.\n• Reset the PlayStation console's video settings: For some PlayStation models, you can reset the video settings to their default configuration, which may resolve video output issues. To do this, turn off your PlayStation console, then press and hold the Power button until you hear two beeps (approximately 5 seconds). This will reset the video settings, and you may need to reconfigure them afterward.\n• Check for interference: Ensure that there are no devices or objects near your PlayStation console or TV that could cause signal interference, such as other electronics, magnets, or wireless devices. Move any potential sources of interference away from the gaming setup and test the AV cable again.\n• Clean the connectors: If the connectors on the AV cable or your PlayStation console appear dirty or corroded, carefully clean them with a soft, dry cloth or a cotton swab dipped in isopropyl alcohol. Make sure to let the connectors dry completely before reconnecting the cable.\n\nIf you've followed these troubleshooting steps and still cannot resolve the issue, it is possible that the Sony PlayStation AV Cable is defective or that there is an issue with your PlayStation console's AV Multi Out port.

I don't say ""great product"" lightly. Not all the publishers we have are ""great"", and while they may have some specific jobs they perform to fit some customers' needs, the Epson Discproducer has a lot of specific features that lots of people can use. For me, first and foremost is the inkjet printing costs. It will cost you about $0.03 per disc when printing black and $0.08 per disc printing in color on this publisher. The unit comes with 6 different ink cartridges, so you only use the colors that you go through the most. Secondly, the automation is excellent and it doesn't have a huge footprint. It can be placed in a viewable part of your office and not look like it's dangerous. It actually could be logically confused for a microwave oven. Finally, Epson software is great, and they stand willing and able to work with you on any specialty integrations you may like.\n\nThe Epson Discproducer PP-100III is the latest generation of Epson's advanced desktop publisher from MediaSupply.com, noted for its high performance, fast throughput, and top reliability. It is designed for unattended operation and can burn and print up to 100 discs at a speed of up to 30 CDs, 15 DVDs, or 8 Blu-ray Discs per hour. And it has all the features you need to get the job done.\n\nDownload the Epson Discproducer PP-100III brochure here.\n\nEpson's Discproducer is a state-of-the-art desktop disc publisher available from MediaSupply. A late-comer to the land of disc publishing, the Discproducer hits a home run with its compact design, reliable and efficient automation, and incredibly low ink costs. A full-color disc printed on the Discproducer costs just $0.08 per disc and black prints only $0.03 per disc. You'll be impressed by the capacity of the Epson ink cartridges, which far exceed the volume of other disc publisher ink cartridges.\n\nThe Discproducer is available in 100-disc, auto printer (print only), and network models, as well as a cost-effective 50-disc publisher.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\n• Best-in-class printing  \nDiscproducer features a built-in inkjet printer with Epson's patented MicroPiezo technology. Using six colors, it delivers the highest print quality in its class with clear, crisp text and vibrant graphics. It offers high-capacity cartridges plus individual LEDs for each ink cartridge to alert you when the ink level is low.\n\n• Advanced robotics  \nDiscproducer's robotic arm with patented AcuGripTM technology ensures that only one disc is placed in the drive or printer at a time, eliminating dual feeding that can damage the drives and interrupt unsupervised production runs.\n\n• Three operating modes  \nMany disc publishers have a single input bin and a single output bin. Epson's Discproducer, however, has three unique operating modes for you to choose from depending on the size of your job: batch mode for larger production runs of up to 100 discs, standard mode for smaller production runs up to 50 discs and external mode for up to 5 discs with mixed media support.\n\n• All-in-one software  \nDiscproducer's easy-to-use Total Disc Maker software includes disc selection, data formatting, label design, and publishing functions all in one package. Using a graphical user interface, you can select data, design a label, configure the job, and click ""Publish"" to start production.\n\n• Industry Leading Service  \nWhen you choose Epson, you get the world-class service you'd expect from a leader.

One of the most consistent requests we receive from our duplicator clients is for an automated copier they can depend on to load up at night, then come back to in the morning with their jobs completed. The Titan Supreme is designed for lights-out operation, with large 1000 disc capacity and robotics optimized to perform unattended operation. The picker mechanism has an anti-stick feature, which helps eliminate discs being stuck together in drives, which is a great feature for a machine of this size when left to run overnight.\n\nKeep in mind the Titan Supreme, because of all these features designed to make the unit work lights-out, is not the fastest copier on the market. It's not ideal pumping out a few hundred discs in an hour. But, if you are looking for unattended, large disc capacity use, this is the DVD/CD duplicator for you. Make note that the Titan Supreme isn't integrated with a printer, so there aren't the alignment or software issues that you might have when using another manufacturer's printer. When working in large volume requirement, it's always wiser to separate your printing from DVD/CD copying anyway.\n\nThe TITAN SUPREME is an Industrial Strength large capacity robotic CD/DVD autoloader duplicator. When your business requires the added edge in overnight continuous duplication with the highest degree of reliability and functionality, the TITAN SUPREME is the answer. This unit is the most robust in our line of autoloaders and is specially designed to perform under the most grueling of continuous duplication conditions. With a revamped robotic arm and spindles that never need to be realigned, the autoloader will provide years of faithful continuous operation.\n\nThe Supreme offers all the exceptional abilities of our TITAN series with a more modular design for easier hardware upgradeability and maintenance in the future. Meaning, any upgrades, modifications, or repairs can be performed quickly and easily so that the unit is back in production with minimal downtime.\n\n• Complete Standalone Operation: No PC required to operate the duplicator.  \n• Maximum 1000 disc capacity  \n• Multi-Master Recognition Technology (MMRT): Can load multiple masters at once to run multiple duplication jobs in succession. In addition able to load the master content to HDD while copying first run of discs.  \n• Upgraded sticky media separator &amp; handling option: Higher probability to separate sticky media. Provides additional setting ""Detect Sticky Media"" to stop the job when 2 or more media are detected in any tray.  \n• Support automatically writer disable feature when specified ""Maximum Failures/Per Recorder"" is reached.  \n• Support automatically job abort feature when specified ""Maximum Total Failures"" is reached  \n• Support automatically eject and close the tray when the media wasn't properly placed.  \n• Auto-Copy feature: System starts duplication process automatically by assuming the 1st disc in the input spindle is the master disc and remaining are the blanks. Supports Manual Duplication Mode.  \n• Continuous Hard Drive Partitioning: The HDD partitions are created without limitations using the same amount of space as the actual content size on the disc. No longer do you have to worry about losing valuable HDD capacity because your duplicator allocates the exact space required without wasting space like standard partitions on other controllers.  \n• Supports all common CD Formats with Additional Special format including CD-TEXT, ISRC, Over-Burned CD.\n\nSPECIAL FEATURES:  \nThe TITAN SUPREME™ autoloader features Multi-Master Recognition Technology (MMRT). Traditionally, autoloaders can only handle one duplication job at a time and additional manpower is needed to load a new duplication job (ex. Load new master disc, insert more blank discs, etc.) Now, with this totally revolutionized auto-master recognition technology, the TITAN SUPREME™ can handle multiple duplication jobs per run by itself.\n\nFor example, if you want to make 200 copies of job A, 50 copies of job B, and 100 copies of job C. Traditional autoloaders will only process one job per run and need someone to load job B and job C to the autoloader. However, with the TITAN SUPREME™ featuring MMRT, it will process all three jobs sequentially per run by itself, without the need to load and reload additional master disc. This process affords the user more time to dedicate to other matters rather than keeping a constant eye on the autoloader.",,,taxable,,1,,,0,0,,,,,1,,,"3498,95",Storage > Optical Drives > DVD Writers,PC Peripherals,,,https://webmall-4.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/mediasupply.com_28.jpg,,,,,,,,,0,

3075,simple,,,D-Link DWS-3160-24TC/E 20 x 10/100/1000BaseT + 4 combo SFP (non-PoE) wireless controller Switch,1,0,visible,The DWS-3160 features 20 10/100/1000BaseT ports and 4 combo SFP ports (non-PoE) with integrated wireless controller capabilities. It offers advanced network management and security for efficient wireless and wired connectivity.,"D-Link DWS-3160-24TC/E 20 x 10/100/1000BaseT + 4 combo SFP (non-PoE) wireless controller Switch  \nPart Number: DWS-3160-24TC/E  \n\nThe DWS-3160 is D-Link’s latest Unified L2+ Gigabit Wireless Switch. Designed to be the ideal mobility solution for medium-sized and large enterprises and service providers, the DWS-3160 empowers administrators to exercise total control over their wireless networks by centralizing all aspects of provisioning and management. Able to manage up to 48 D-Link Unified Access Points by itself and up to 192 in a Peer Group, the DWS-3160 can be configured to act either as a Wireless Controller in the core network and as an L2+ Gigabit Switch at the edge, enabling it to be seamlessly integrated into any existing network infrastructure. The DWS-3160 comes in two models with or without PoE support.  \n\nSimplified Management  \nThe DWS-3160 is able to centralize all critical WLAN management, thereby eliminating the need to manage access points individually. The administrator simply assigns a profile to an individual D-Link Unified Access Point, and the configuration corresponding to that profile would be applied onto that access point automatically. In addition, the DWS-3160 can apply new firmware to all D-Link Unified Access Points on the network, thus greatly simplifying the upgrade process. The DWS-3160 also excels as an advanced L2+ switch. Complete with RIPv1/v2 dynamic routing, ACL security, multi-layer QoS, comprehensive VLAN support, as well as Multicast Snooping capabilities, the DWS-3160 enables easy and flexible deployment. Furthermore, multiple DWS-3160s can form a Peer Group, which enables the administrator to configure all switches from one Peer Group Master. As the size of the Peer Group grows, so can the number of D-Link Unified Access Points being managed. Up to 192 D-Link Unified Access Points may be managed by a Peer Group. This helps to significantly simplify management and reduce maintenance efforts when a network is scaled up.  \n\nTrusted Security  \nThe DWS-3160 offers a state-of-the-art Wireless Intrusion Detection System (WIDS), which empowers administrators to detect Rogue Access Points and Rogue Clients, effectively preventing them from causing damage to the network. The administrator can also activate various threat detections and use Radio Frequency Scan to sweep the entire wireless network to identify any possible security breach in advance. When working in conjunction with D-Link Unified Access Points, Virtual Access Points may be easily configured and managed, allowing the administrator to assign different access privileges to different classes of users. In addition to WPA and WPA2, an added measure of protection is added with an advanced captive portal, thus enabling only authorized users to utilize the wireless network. On the wired side, the DWS-3160 utilizes Access Control Lists to tightly control what goes in and out of the network by setting up a number of simple rules. Along with other advanced security features, such as 802.1X Network Access Control and advanced Denial-of-Service Protection, the DWS-3160 provides robust and centralized security, ensuring maximum network reliability.  \n\nNetwork Resiliency  \nWhen a number of access points are deployed close to each other, interference may result if proper RF management is not implemented. The DWS-3160 is aware of how the radio spectrum is being utilized in the network and will automatically assign the most optimized channel to each access point under its management. This greatly reduces RF interference and will allow the administrator to deploy APs more densely. To further minimize interference, the DWS-3160 also can adjust the transmit power of each radio independently. When, for whatever reason, there is no longer so many access points present, transmission power will be increased to expand network coverage. To ensure that no access point is overburdened while others sit idle, the DWS-3160 will prevent certain D-Link Unified Access Points from accepting new association requests if its resources are fully utilized. A neighboring D-Link Unified Access Point will instead pick up the load. This ensures that proper load balancing is in place, and the network will function in the most optimal state.  \n\nSeamless Mobility  \nWireless clients can enjoy seamless and uninterrupted roaming from AP to AP if they are managed by the same DWS-3160, even if they are not in the same subnet. Because the DWS-3160 employs various mechanisms such as pre-authentication and key caching, wireless users can freely roam the entire network without needing to re-authenticate. This allows tablet and smartphone and netbook computer users to travel freely within any premises covered by the DWS-3160’s managed APs without having to worry about network connectivity, thus enabling a truly mobile workplace.  \n\nSPECIFICATION  \nSize  \n19-inch Standard Rack-Mount Width, 1U Height  \n\nNetwork Interfaces  \n20 10/100/1000Base-T  \n4 Combo 10/100/1000Base-T/SFP  \n\nConsole Port  \nRJ45 RS-232  \n\nMAC Address Table  \n16K  \n\nMaximum Power Consumption  \n37.7 W  \n\nSwitching Capacity  \n48 Gbps  \n\nMaximum Forwarding Rate  \n35.71 Million Packets per Second  \n\nForwarding Method  \nStore and Forward  \n\nPacket Buffer Memory  \nUp to 256 static MAC entries  \nEnable/disable auto-learning of MAC addresses  \n\nNumber of VLANs per Device  \n4K  \n\nStatic Routes  \n512  \n\nJumbo Frames  \n13K  \n\nMTBF  \n561,829 hours  \n\nAcoustic  \nBelow 30 °C (86 °F) &lt; 46.3 dB  \nOver 30 °C (86 °F): &lt; 33.0 dB  \n\nHeat Dissipation  \n128.6 BTU/hr  \n\nDimensions  \n440 x 210 x 44 mm (17.32 x 8.27 x 1.73 inches)  \n\nRedundant Power Supply  \nDPS-200  \n\nWeight (without optional module)  \n2.55 kg (5.63 pounds)  \n\nOperating Temperature  \n0 to 50 °C (32 to °F)  \n\nStorage Temperature  \n-40 to 70 °C ( to 158 °F)  \n\nOperating Humidity  \n10% to 90% RH  \n\nStorage Humidity  \n5% to 90% RH  \n\nEMI Certifications  \nFCC Class A  \nCE  \nICES-003  \nC-Tick  \nVCCI  \n\nSafety  \nUL/cUL  \nCB  \n\nManagement  \nManages up to 48 Unified Access Points per switch, up to 192 APs per cluster  \nSwitch Cluster for Single IP Management  \nSSH  \nSSL  \nSNMP v1, 2c, 3  \nsFlow  \nDual Image Support  \nWeb GUI  \nCommand Line Interface  \n\nAP Management  \nAP Auto-Discovery  \nRemote AP Reboot  \nAP Monitoring: List Managed AP, Rogue AP, Authentication Failed AP  \nClient Monitoring: List clients associated with each Managed AP  \nAd-hoc Client Monitoring  \nAP Authentication Supporting Local Database and External RADIUS Server  \nCentralized RF/Security Policy Management  \nAutomatic AP RF Channel Adjustment  \nAutomatic AP Transmit Output Power Adjustment  \nCentralized Firmware Upgrade  \n\nManaged Unified Access Points  \nDWL-3600AP  \nDWL-6600AP  \nDWL-8600AP  \n\nRoaming  \nFast Roaming  \nIntra-Switch/Inter-Switch Roaming  \nIntra-Subnet/Inter-Subnet Roaming  \n\nAccess Control &amp; Bandwidth Management  \nUp to 32 SSID per AP (16 SSID per frequency band)  \nAP Load Balancing based on the number of users or AP utilization  \nFlexible Mapping Schemes  \n\nL2 Features  \nIGMP Snooping  \nMLD Snooping  \n802.1D/w/s Spanning Tree  \n802.3ad Link Aggregation  \n802.1ab LLDP  \nPort Mirroring (One-to-One and Many-to-One)  \nJumbo Frame Size: Up to 13 KB  \n\nL3 Features  \nIPv4/v6 Static Route  \nRouting Table Size: 512 Static Routes  \nVRRP  \nARP Proxy  \n\nLAN Security  \nRADIUS Authentication  \nManagement Access  \nTACACS+ Authentication for Management Access  \nSSH &amp; SSL Support  \nMAC Filtering  \n802.1X Port-based Access Control &amp; Guest VLAN  \nDenial of Service Protection  \nDynamic ARP Inspection  \nProtected Port  \nBroadcast Storm Control  \nAccess Control List  \n\nMIB  \n1213 MIB II  \n1493 Bridge MIB  \n1907 SNMP v2 MIB  \n1215 Trap Convention MIB  \n2233 Interface Group MIB  \nD-Link Private MIB  \nLLDP MIB  \nPower-Ethernet MIB  \n\nLAN Flow Control  \n802.3x Standard in Full-Duplex Mode  \nBack Pressure in Half-Duplex Mode  \nHead-of-Line Blocking Prevention  \n\nQoS (Quality of Service)  \nVoice VLAN  \nWireless Multimedia (WMM)  \n802.1p Priority Queues  \nCoS-based QoS  \nPer-Flow Bandwidth Control  \nPer-Port Traffic Shaping  \nMinimum Bandwidth Guarantee  \n\nVLAN  \n802.1Q VLAN Tagging  \n802.1V Subnet-based VLAN  \nMAC-based VLAN  \nGVRP  \nDouble VLAN  \nVoice VLAN  \n\nWLAN Security  \nWPA Personal/Enterprise  \nWPA2 Personal/Enterprise  \n64/128/152-bit WEP Data Encryption  \nMAC Authentication  \nStation Isolation  \nWireless Station and AP Monitoring based on RF Channel, MAC Address, SSID, Time  \nRogue AP and Client Detection &amp; Mitigation  \nCaptive Portal  \nSecurity Profile  \n802.1X Support  \nGuest VLAN  \n\nProduct Datasheet",,,taxable,,1,,,0,0,,,,,1,,,"247,28",Networking > Switches,PC Peripherals,,,https://webmall-4.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/redstarafrica.com_282.png,,,,,,,,,0,

The Cable Diagnostic feature designed primarily for administrators and customer service representatives, can rapidly discover the type of error and determine the cable quality.  \n\nSecure your Network  \nD-Link’s innovative Safeguard Engine protects the switches against traffic flooding caused by virus attacks. The switches also support 802.1X port-based authentication, allowing the network clients to be authenticated through external RADIUS servers. In addition, the Access Control List (ACL) feature enhances network security and protects the network by screening traffic from illegal MAC or IP addresses. ARP Spoofing Prevention prevents malicious intruders from sending massive fake ARP messages through a manipulated source. This protects important data from being stolen by Man-in-the-Middle attacks, and prevents wasting CPU cycles on these packets. For added security, the DHCP Server Screening feature blocks rogue DHCP server packets from user ports to prevent unauthorized IP assignment.  \n\nSPECIFICATION  \n\nGeneral  \nPort Standards &amp; Functions  \n• IEEE 802.3 10BASE-T Ethernet (twisted-pair copper)  \n• IEEE 802.3u 100BASE-TX Fast Ethernet (twisted-pair copper)  \n• IEEE 802.3ab 1000BASE-T Gigabit Ethernet (twisted-pair copper)  \n• Auto-negotiation  \n• IEEE 802.3x Flow Control  \n\nNumber of Ports  \n• 48 10/100/1000 Mbps  \n• 4 Gigabit SFP  \n\nNetwork Cables  \n• UTP Cat.5, Cat.5e (100m max)  \n• EIA/TIA-568 100-ohm STP (100m max)  \n\nFull/Half Duplex  \n• Full/half duplex for 10/100Mbps speeds  \n• Full duplex for Gigabit speed  \n\nMedia Interface Exchange  \n• Auto MDI/MDI-X adjustment for all twisted-pair ports  \n\nPerformance  \nSwitching Capacity  \n• 104 Gbps  \n\nTransmission Method  \n• Store-and-forward  \n\nMAC Address Table  \n• 16,000 entries per device  \n\nMAC Address Update  \n• Up to 256 static MAC entries  \n• Enable/disable auto-learning of MAC addresses  \n\nMaximum 64 bytes packet forwarding rate  \n• 77.4 Mpps  \n\nPacket Buffer Memory  \n• 1 MB per device  \n\nPhysical and Environmental  \nAC Input  \n• 100 to 240 VAC 50/60Hz internal universal power supply  \n\nMaximum Power Consumption  \n• 43.5W  \n\nStandby Power Consumption  \n• 20.7W/110V, 22W/240V  \n\nFan Quantity  \n• Two smart fans  \n\nAcoustics  \n• 47.1 dB(A)  \n\nHeat Dissipation  \n• 148.42 BTU/hr.  \n\nOperating Temperature  \n• 41° to 122°F (-5° to 50°C)  \n\nStorage Temperature  \n• -4° to 158°F (-20° to 70°C)  \n\nOperating Humidity  \n• 0% to 95% non-condensing  \n\nStorage Humidity  \n• 0% to 95% non-condensing  \n\nDimensions  \n• 17.32 x 9.84 x 1.73 inches; (440 x 250 x 44 mm)  \n• 19-inch standard rack mounting width, 1U height  \n\nWeight  \n• 9.0 lbs (4.1kg)  \n\nDiagnostic LEDs  \n• Power (per device)  \n• Link/Activity/Speed (per 10/100/1000Mbps port)  \n• Link/Activity (per SFP port)  \n• Fan (per device)  \n\nMTBF  \n• 201,517 hours  \n\nCertifications  \n• FCC Class A  \n• CE Class A  \n• ICES-003  \n• VCCI Class A  \n• C-Tick  \n• BSMI  \n\nSafety  \n• cUL  \n• CE LVD  \n\nSoftware Features  \n\nL2 Features  \n• MAC Address Table  \n  -

Supports PoE powered or external power adapter.,"D-Link DGS-1100-08PD/E 8-port 10/100/1000Mbps ports with 1 PD port Smart switch PoE Powered or powered by external power adaptor  \nPart Number: DGS-1100-08PD/E  \n\nDescription:  \nThe DGS-1100-08PD is a switch designed to meet the requirements of small, medium, and enterprise businesses. Advanced management features, a range of diagnostic and troubleshooting tools, and energy efficient technologies provide a flexible solution to meet your networking requirements.  \n\nD-Link Green/Power Saving Performance  \nCompliant with IEEE 802.3az Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE), the DGS-1100 Series consumes less energy by cutting down on power consumption when port utilization is low. By deploying compatible devices, users can cut operating costs and even cut down on additional cooling equipment, helping small and medium-sized businesses stay within their budgets. The DGS-1100 Series also features D-Link Green technology that helps save energy automatically. The switches monitor the link status of every port and significantly reduce power consumption of the interface when there is no link or network traffic detected.  \n\nEasy to Deploy  \nThe DGS-1100 Series supports an intuitive client-based utility (D-Link Network Assistant) and a web-based management interface. The client-based D-Link Network Assistant (DNA) discovers all D-Link Smart Managed Switches within the same Layer 2 network segment, making the initial setup quick and easy. This allows extensive switch configuration and basic administration of discovered devices, including password changes and firmware upgrades. The web-based interface provides a user-friendly way for network administrators to manage the switch down to the port level. The interface can be accessed from a web browser, allowing the switches to be controlled from any PC that is connected to the network.  \n\nSurveillance VLAN and Bandwidth Control  \nThe DGS-1100 Series supports Surveillance VLAN for IP surveillance deployments. This gives video traffic a dedicated VLAN and higher priority through the switch, separating surveillance traffic from the rest of the network. This ensures security and guarantees the quality of the video traffic, sparing businesses the added cost of dedicated surveillance hardware. Bandwidth Control can reserve bandwidth on a per-port basis for important functions that require larger bandwidth or have higher priority.  \n\nAdvanced Features  \nThe DGS-1100 Series is equipped with advanced security features such as Static MAC, Storm Control, and IGMP Snooping. Static MAC allows users to create a MAC whitelist for specific ports, helping administrators limit network access to authorized devices only. Storm Control monitors broadcast, multicast, or unknown unicast traffic and will start blocking or discarding packets which could flood the network when the defined threshold is exceeded. IGMP Snooping is able to reduce the load of L3 multicast routers and save bandwidth in network throughput.  \n\nEasy Troubleshooting  \nThe DGS-1100 Series features Loopback Detection and Cable Diagnostics to help network administrators find and solve network problems quickly and easily. Loopback Detection is used to detect loops created by a specific port and automatically shuts down the affected port. Cable Diagnostics helps network administrators quickly examine the quality of the copper cables, recognize the cable type, and detect cable errors.  \n\nGeneral features:  \nNumber of Ports  \n• 8 10/100/1000 Mbps  \n\nPort Functions  \n• IEEE 802.3 for Ethernet  \n• IEEE 802.3u for Fast Ethernet  \n• IEEE 802.3ab for Gigabit Ethernet  \n• Auto-negotiation  \n• Supports half/full-duplex operation (half at 10/100 Mbps, full at 1000 Mbps)  \n• Auto MDI/MDIX  \n• IEEE 802.3x Flow Control supports full-duplex mode  \n• IEEE 802.3az compliant  \n\nSwitching Capacity  \n• 6 Gbps  \n\nMaximum Forwarding Rate  \n• 11.9 Mpps  \n\nMAC Address Table Size  \n• 8K entries  \n\nPacket Buffer  \n• 4.1 Mbits  \n\nFlash Memory  \n• 32 Mbytes  \n\nPower Consumption  \n• Standby Mode: 1.97 W  \n• Maximum Power Consumption: 4.72 W  \n\nPower Input  \n• 100 to 240 V AC 50 to 60 Hz external power adapter  \n• 802.3af PoE power via PD port  \n\nMTBF  \n• 648,153 hours  \n\nAcoustics  \n• 0 dB(A)  \n\nHeat Dissipation  \n• 52 BTU/hr  \n\nWeight  \n• 0.45 kg  \n\nDimensions  \n• 171 x 98 x 27.5 mm  \n\nVentilation  \n• Fanless  \n\nOperating Temperature  \n• 0 to 40 °C  \n\nStorage Temperature  \n• -40 to 70 °C  \n\nOperating Humidity  \n• 0% to 90% RH, non-condensing  \n\nStorage Humidity  \n• 0% to 95% RH, non-condensing  \n\nEMI  \n• FCC Class B, CE Class B, VCCI Class B, BSMI, CCC  \n\nSafety  \n• cUL, CE LVD, CB, BSMI, CCC  \n\nVLAN  \n• Port-based VLAN  \n• 802.1Q tagged VLAN  \n• Surveillance VLAN  \n• Voice VLAN  \n• Management VLAN  \n• VLAN Group  \n• Supports 32 static VLAN groups  \n• Max. 4094 VIDs  \n• Asymmetric VLAN  \n\nL2 Features  \n• Flow Control: 802.3x Flow Control, HOL Blocking Prevention  \n• Jumbo frames up to 9216 bytes  \n• IGMP Snooping: IGMP v1/v2 Snooping, Supports 128 Groups  \n• Static Trunk: 2 groups  \n• Loopback Detection  \n• Cable diagnostics  \n• Port mirroring: One-to-One, Many-to-One  \n• Statistics: Tx Ok, Tx Error, Rx Ok, Rx Error  \n\nQuality of Service (QoS)  \n• 802.1p Quality of Service  \n• 4 queues per port  \n• Queue handling: Strict, Weighted Round Robin (WRR)  \n• Bandwidth control: Port-based (Ingress/Egress, min granularity 16 Kb/s)  \n• DSCP  \n\nSecurity  \n• Static MAC addresses: Up to 32 entries  \n• Traffic segmentation  \n• Broadcast/Multicast/Unknown Unicast Storm Control  \n• Port security  \n\nManagement  \n• Web-based GUI (Supports IPv4)  \n• D-Link Network Assistant (DNA)  \n\nD-Link Green  \n• Compliant with RoHS 6  \n• Compliant with IEEE 802.3az Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE)  \n\nRFC Standard List  \n• RFC768 UDP  \n• RFC791 IP  \n• RFC792 ICMP  \n• RFC793 TCP  \n• RFC826 ARP  \n• IEEE 802.1p  \n• RFC2236, IGMP Snooping  \n• RFC1213 MIBII  \n• RFC1215 MIB Traps Convention  \n\nProduct Datasheet",,,taxable,,1,,,0,0,,,,,1,,,"65,97",Networking > Switches > PoE Switches,PC Peripherals,,,https://webmall-4.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/redstarafrica.com_11.png,,,,,,,,,0,

Part of the DES-1210 series.,"D-Link DES-1210-52 48-Port 10/100BaseT + 2-Port 10/100/1000Mbps Copper + 2 Combo Copper/SFP Smart Switch  \nPart Number: DES-1210-52  \n\nDescription  \nThe DES-1210 Series is the latest generation of D-Link Web Smart switches. Equipped with 24 or 48 10/100 Mbps ports, 2 10/100/1000BASE-T ports, and 2 combo 10/100/1000BASE-T/SFP ports, the DES-1210 Series integrates advanced management and security functions for enhanced performance and scalability. The DES-1210-08P/28P are built with 10/100 Mbps ports that are PoE-enabled, offering ease-of-use and green features such as Timebased PoE, which can shut off PoE power at a predetermined time. The Smart Fan feature on the DES-1210-28P allows the built-in fans to automatically turn on at a certain temperature, providing continuous, reliable, and eco-friendly operation of the switch. Compliant with 802.3af and 802.3at, the DES-1210-28P is capable of feeding power of up to 30 watts to devices. Management options include SNMP, Web Management, SmartConsole Utility, and Compact Command Line for easy deployment. The DES-1210 Series provides a complete and affordable solution that is ideal for small and medium businesses and the enterprise edge.  \n\nSeamless Integration  \nThe Web Smart switches are designed to provide SMB users with complete control over their network. With Ethernet and Gigabit copper ports capable of connecting to existing CAT5 twisted-pair cables, these switches eliminate the need for complex reconfiguration. The DES-1210 Series allows for flexible connection to a backbone or server. Additionally, all ports support auto-negotiation of MDI/MDIX crossover, eliminating the need for crossover cables or uplink ports.  \n\nExtensive Layer 2 Features  \nEquipped with a complete lineup of L2 features, these switches include IGMP Snooping, Port Mirroring, Spanning Tree, and Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP). IEEE 802.3x Flow Control allows servers to directly connect to the switch for reliable data transfer. At 2000 Mbps full-duplex, the Gigabit ports provide high-speed data pipes to servers with minimum data transfer loss. Network maintenance features include Loopback Detection and Cable Diagnostics. Loopback Detection is used to detect loops created by a specific port and automatically shuts down the affected port. Cable Diagnostics allow network administrators to quickly examine the quality of the copper cables and also determine the type of cable error.  \n\nQoS &amp; Bandwidth Control  \nThe DES-1210 Series switches support Auto Surveillance VLAN (ASV) and Auto Voice VLAN for VoIP and video surveillance deployments. ASV ensures the quality of real-time video for monitoring and control without compromising the transmission of conventional network data. DSCP markings on Ethernet packets enable different levels of service to be assigned to network traffic. In addition, with Bandwidth Control, network administrators can reserve bandwidth for important functions that require more bandwidth or require high priority.  \n\nSecure Your Network  \nD-Link’s innovative Safeguard Engine protects against traffic flooding caused by virus attacks. These switches also support 802.1X port-based authentication, allowing the network to be authenticated through external RADIUS servers. In addition, the Access Control List (ACL) feature enhances network security and protects the internal IT network. The DES-1210 Series supports ARP Spoofing Prevention, which prevents the network from being cut off or eavesdropped by hackers using faked ARPs that pretend to be PCs, servers, routers, or gateways. For added security, DHCP Server Screening screens rogue DHCP server packets from user ports to prevent unauthorized IP assignment.  \n\nVersatile Management  \nThis new generation of Web Smart Switches provides growing businesses with simple and easy management of their network by using an intuitive SmartConsole utility and a web-based management interface that enables administrators to remotely control their network down to the port level. The SmartConsole allows customers to easily discover multiple D-Link Web Smart Switches within the same L2 network segment. With this utility, users do not need to change the IP address of their PC and it also provides an easy setup of the Smart Switches. Switches within the same L2 network segment that are connected to the user’s local PC are displayed on screen for instant access. This allows for extensive switch configuration settings and basic configuration (password changes and firmware upgrades) of discovered devices. The DES-1210 Series supports D-View 6.0 and Compact Command Line Interface (CLI) control through Telnet. D-View 6.0 is a Network Management System that allows for central management of critical network characteristics and provides a useful set of tools for network administrators who want to effectively manage device configurations, fault tolerance, performance, and security. CLI management of switches is possible via Telnet, and allowing administrators to perform basic operations such as password changes, firmware upgrades, and configuration file uploads.  \n\n• 48 Port 10/100 Base-T POE Switch with 2 x 10/100/1000 Base-T Ports  \n• Support 2 x 10/100/1000 Base-T/SFP Combo Slots  \n• IEEE 802.1Q Virtual LAN (VLAN)  \n• Support IGMP and MLD Snooping  \n• Support Auto Surveillance and Auto Voice VLAN  \n• Broadcast, Unicast and Multicast Storm Control  \n• Support Smart IP-MAC-Port Binding  \n• Support IEEE 802.1p QOS and COS  \n• 802.1x port-base Authentication through RADIUS servers  \n\nProduct Datasheet",,,taxable,,1,,,0,0,,,,,1,,,"290,85",Networking > Switches,PC Peripherals,,,https://webmall-4.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/redstarafrica.com_195.png,,,,,,,,,0,

It not only cancels significantly more noise across almost all frequencies, but it also uses less power.  \n\nAtmospheric Pressure Optimizing  \n• Our noise cancelling is made to fly with Atmospheric Pressure Optimizing. Enjoy in-flight entertainment with noise cancelling optimized for high altitude.  \n\nHD Hybrid Driver System  \n• Sound is optimized across the frequencies with the HD Hybrid Driver System.

You can also customize the settings to your preferences.  \n\nBe in control of your listening  \n• With the Sony | Headphones Connect app, Ambient Sound Control lets you adjust the volume of background sound and gives you the option to allow voices alone to be heard.

The headphones’ rigid housings are constructed of pure titanium to greatly reduce unwanted resonance, and they feature A2DC (Audio Designed Detachable Coaxial) jacks to accommodate the two 1.2 m (3.9') detachable cables included with the headphones. One cable is equipped with a standard 3.5 mm 3-pole stereo mini-plug; the other has a 4.4 mm 5-pole balanced mini-plug that allows the headphones to be used with the latest high-spec audio players. Also included are earpads, a hard carrying case, and cleaning cloth. Each pair of the exclusive ATH-CM2000Ti in-ear headphones is individually identified by a laser-etched serial number.\n\nAbout High-Resolution Audio\n\nIn Brief: The Move to Hi-Res Audio\n\nWhile many listeners may believe that high-resolution audio came along with the introduction of the Compact Disc in 1982, constraints on the disc’s storage space always prevented CD audio (standardized at 44.1 kHz/16-bit) from fully and completely reproducing the original recorded sound. The advent and subsequent popularity of MP3s only made this problem more pronounced – the necessary compression of these files causes audio information to be lost, thus greatly reducing the audio quality. But with lossless audio file formats, faster Internet speeds, and storage space increasingly easy to come by (and in ever-smaller packages), the push is on to create audio equipment capable of capturing and reproducing true Hi-Res Audio, generally considered to be 96 kHz/24-bit or better. The Hi-Res Audio logo certifies that a product meets the Hi-Res Audio standards. Per these standards, headphones must have transducer frequency performance to at least 40 kHz. As a producer of these types of audiophile headphones since 1972, Audio-Technica is well-positioned to provide audio solutions that meet the demands of Hi-Res Audio media formats, allowing for the full reproduction of their extended sonic characteristics.\n\nFeatures\n\n• Specially designed 15.4 mm HD drivers with a permendur magnetic circuit are capable of Hi-Res Audio reproduction  \n• Diamond-like carbon (DLC) coating on diaphragms helps to deliver exceptional full-range audio  \n• Rigid, pure-titanium housings reduce unwanted resonance  \n• Two detachable 1.2 m (3.9') cables with A2DC (Audio Designed Detachable Coaxial) connectors at the headphones: one with a 4.4 mm 5-pole balanced mini-plug, the other with a 3.5 mm 3-pole stereo mini-plug  \n• Includes earpads, hard carrying case, and cleaning cloth  \n• Each pair of headphones is individually identified by a laser-etched serial number",,,taxable,,1,,,0,0,,,,,1,,,"374,53",Audio > Earbuds,Other Electronics,,,https://webmall-4.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/thepowercentre.ca_67.png,,,,,,,,,0,

An all-metal shroud houses three powerful axial-tech fans with dual ball fan bearings and extra blades. Under the exoskeleton, a thick heatsink keeps thermals under tight control and TUF components, selected for maximum durability and performance, keep the card ahead of the pack. You asked for a mean machine... this one is ready for action.\n\nFans\n\nBigger Better Cooling  \nThis generation, our Axial-tech fan design has matured with an increased blade count on all three fans: 13 on the centre fan and 11 on the auxiliary fans. The barrier rings on the side fans have been slimmed down to allow for more lateral intake and to provide better airflow through the cooling array. The center fan's extra blades and full-height ring provide boosted static pressure to blast air directly onto the GPU heat spreader. The fan design growth is specifically optimized for a massive new heatsink that features more fins and surface area than previous iterations.\n\nQuiet Cunning  \nTo bolster the specialized roles of the center and auxiliary fans, the rotational direction of the center fan is reversed. This reduces air turbulence inside the cooling array for another boost to overall thermal performance. Fans will also only start spinning when the GPU temperature hits 60 Celsius and shut off when temps drop below 55 Celsius, helping to reduce noise when the system is idling or under light load.\n\nHeatsink\n\nMAXCONTACT  \nTo get heat up off the die and into the heatsink array, we've engaged MaxContact technology to polish the surface of the heat spreader and improve smoothness at the microscopic level. The extra flatness allows for better contact with the die for enhanced thermal transfer.\n\n2.9-Slot Design  \nThe heat spreader draws heat up into heatpipes that carry it through a fin stack that fills most of the card's large, 2.9-slot footprint.\n\nPCB\n\nTUF Components  \nRobust military-grade capacitors were selected for the card's power design. They and other components are soldered to the PCB using our Auto-Extreme automated manufacturing process. Precise joints and the elimination of human error ensures each graphics card meets our rigorous specifications. To ensure flawless performance when it counts, the cards are subjected to a grueling 144-hour validation trial.\n\nDesign\n\nMetal Coat  \nA machined all-aluminum shroud creates a robust outer shell and a no-nonsense industrial design and grayscale colorway fits into any build with ease.\n\nArmored Underside  \nThe underside of the card reveals further improvements. Most of the rear is swathed in a protective metal backplate that prominently features a wide vent. The vent allows hot air to escape towards chassis exhaust fans instead of being recycled back into the GPU cooler. A GPU bracket provides extra stability to the critical connection between die and heat spreader. Stainless steel is used for the I/O bracket to protect ports and provide a more secure mount. And a conveniently placed Dual Bios switch allows customization of the card's default performance profile without software.\n\nFunctional Front  \nThe front-side RGB element can be customized to display a range of aesthetic and functional effects, and also synced with other ASUS components to enable uniform lighting. To fulfill the power demands of the Radeon RX 6950 XT, two 8-pin power connectors are present, along with onboard LEDs that light up if PSU PCIe power connectors are not plugged in correctly.
