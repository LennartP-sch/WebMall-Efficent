Now in its 11th generation, it places the tweeter in the acoustic centre of the bass/midrange cone, allowing LS50 Wireless to create a more detailed, accurate and beautifully integrated three-dimensional sound image.\n\nCrossover Timing Correction  \nHigh and low frequencies should hit your ears at exactly the right time.

Get the performance you need, where you need it, whether you’re a gamer, creator, streamer, or everyday user. Whatever you’re into, do more of it, whenever you want with Intel® 12 Generation processors. With unprecedented new performance hybrid architecture, 12th Gen Intel® Core™ processors offer a unique combination of Performance and Efficient-cores (P-core and E-core). That means real-world performance, intuitively scaled to match whatever you’re doing. The Performance-core is Intel’s highest-performing CPU core ever. And it’s designed to maximize single-thread performance and responsiveness for compute-intensive workloads like gaming and 3D design. The Efficient-core delivers multithreaded performance for tasks that can run in parallel (like image rendering), along with an efficient offload of background tasks for modern multitasking. So that Performance-cores and Efficient-cores can work seamlessly with the operating system, Intel built Intel®'s Thread Director right into the hardware. Automatically monitoring and analyzing on-the-fly, Intel® Thread Director guides the operating system, helping it place the right thread on the right core, at the right time. And it does it all dynamically, adapting scheduling guidance based on actual computing needs, not on static rules. 12th Gen Intel® Core™ processors also support the next wave of discrete graphics cards and storage devices. These devices take advantage of the increased throughput coming with PCIe 5.0 as well the higher speeds and bandwidth of DDR5 memory. With 12th Gen Intel® Core™ processors, standard, built-in features enable capabilities like noise suppression, auto-framing, and optimization for bandwidth and video resolution while gaming. That saves you time and lets you multitask in ways you’ve only ever dreamed of, until now. From epic gaming to browsing to streaming to creating your next masterpiece, 12th Gen Intel® Core™ processors make it all entirely doable.\n\nFEATURES:\n• 4 Cores 8 Threads\n• Max Turbo Frequency of up to 4.30GHz\n• 12MB Intel® Smart Cache\n• Support for DDR4 and DDR5 memory\n• Built for serious gaming\n• Smart solutions for enthusiasts and creators\n• Nearly 3x faster connectivity\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\nEssentials:\nProduct Collection: 12th Generation Intel® Core™ i3 Processors  \nCode Name: Products formerly Alder Lake  \nVertical Segment: Desktop  \nProcessor Number: i3-12100F  \n\nCPU Specifications:\nTotal Cores: 4  \n# of Performance-cores: 4  \n# of Efficient-cores: 0  \nTotal Threads: 8  \nMax Turbo Frequency: 4.30 GHz  \nPerformance-core Max Turbo Frequency: 4.30 GHz  \nPerformance-core Base Frequency: 3.30 GHz  \nCache: 12 MB Intel® Smart Cache  \nTotal L2 Cache: 5 MB  \nProcessor Base Power: 58 W  \nMaximum Turbo Power: 89 W  \n\nMemory Specifications:\nMax Memory Size (dependent on memory type): 128 GB  \nMemory Types: Up to DDR5 4800 MT/s, Up to DDR4 3200 MT/s  \nMax # of Memory Channels: 2  \nMax Memory Bandwidth: 76.8 GB/s  \n\nExpansion Options:\nDirect Media Interface (DMI) Revision: 4.0  \nMax # of DMI Lanes: 8  \nScalability: 1S Only  \nPCI Express Revision: 5.0 and 4.0  \nPCI Express Configurations: Up to 1×16+4, 2×8+4  \nMax # of PCI Express Lanes: 20  \n\nAdvanced Features:\nIntel® Gaussian &amp; Neural Accelerator: 3.0  \nIntel® Thread Director: No  \nIntel® Deep Learning Boost (Intel® DL Boost): Yes  \nIntel® Optane™ Memory Supported: Yes  \nIntel® Speed Shift Technology: Yes  \nIntel® Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0: No  \nIntel® Turbo Boost Technology: 2.0  \nIntel® Hyper-Threading Technology: Yes  \nIntel® 64: Yes  \nInstruction Set: 64-bit  \nInstruction Set Extensions: Intel® SSE4.1, Intel® SSE4.2, Intel® AVX2  \nIdle States: Yes  \nEnhanced Intel SpeedStep® Technology: Yes  \nThermal Monitoring Technologies: Yes  \nIntel® Volume Management Device (VMD): Yes  \n\nSecurity &amp; Reliability:\nIntel® Standard Manageability (ISM): Yes  \nIntel® Control-Flow Enforcement Technology: Yes  \nIntel® AES New Instructions: Yes  \nSecure Key: Yes  \nIntel® OS Guard: Yes  \nExecute Disable Bit: Yes  \nIntel® Boot Guard: Yes  \nMode-based Execute Control (MBEC): Yes  \nIntel® Virtualization Technology (VT-x): Yes  \nIntel® Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O (VT-d): Yes  \nIntel® VT-x with Extended Page Tables (EPT): Yes  \n\nWHAT’S IN THE BOX:  \nIntel 12th Gen Core i3-12100F LGA1700 3.3GHz 4-Core CPU x1",,,taxable,,1,,,0,0,,,,,1,,,85.7,Hardware > PC Components > Processors,PC Components,,,https://webmall-2.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/dynacor.co_.za_209.jpg,,,,,,,,,0,

The EF 85mm f/1.4L IS USM has been designed to produce flattering skin tones and beautiful perspective for stunning portrait and wedding photography. Featuring a new 14 elements, 10 group, lens design, the EF 85mm includes high-quality, high-precision elements to correct chromatic aberration and to deliver the optical performance required by the latest high-resolution sensors. The quality of the image is further enhanced thanks to Air Sphere Coating (ASC) technology. This ultra-low refractive index layer on the EF 85mm eliminates image flare and ghosting to ensure clear and attractive images. The EF 85mm utilizes one large diameter, high-precision moulded glass aspherical lens and features an ASC coating. The large f/1.4 aperture produces shallow depth-of-field, fast shutter speeds and a bright image inside the viewfinder, allowing photographers to focus and compose their image reliably. In addition, a circular aperture with 9-blade iris allows for beautiful bokeh.

Featuring a new 14 elements, 10 group, lens design, the EF 85mm includes high-quality, high-precision elements to correct chromatic aberration and to deliver the optical performance required by the latest high-resolution sensors. The quality of the image is further enhanced thanks to Air Sphere Coating (ASC) technology. This ultra-low refractive index layer on the EF 85mm eliminates image flare and ghosting to ensure clear and attractive images. The EF 85mm utilizes one large diameter, high-precision moulded glass aspherical lens and features an ASC coating. The large f/1.4 aperture produces shallow depth-of-field, fast shutter speeds and a bright image inside the viewfinder, allowing photographers to focus and compose their image reliably. In addition, a circular aperture with 9-blade iris allows for beautiful bokeh. The EF 85mm is equipped with an Electro Magnetic diaphragm, which uses a wide f/1.4 aperture comprised of nine blades. This allows the lens to capture an attractive “bokeh” look, which is essential for striking shots. The aperture is also capable of transmitting more light to boost exposure and depth-of-field control. This fast aperture performance is crucial for standout portraits where the subject is the key focal point. Photographers can also enjoy unparalleled stability via the EF 85mm’s 4-stop image stabilisation, which prevents camera shake from ruining images. The combination of image stabilisation and fast aperture make the EF 85mm perfect for use in videography. The EF 85mm has a high-speed ring type Ultrasonic Motor (USM) driven Auto Focus (AF), which works with the lens CPU and the camera’s AF algorithms to provide fast and accurate AF. The USM driven AF is also completely silent, which supports a photographer’s ability to shoot great images discreetly at events such as weddings. The AF also features a full-time manual override and is compatible with the entire family of Cinema EOS cameras. The lens also benefits from the enhanced durability provided by Canon’s L-series lens construction. Thanks to the EF 85mm’s weather sealing, dustproofing and fluorine coating, this lens has been specifically designed for tough and variable weather conditions. The complete package of features included in the EF 85mm makes this lens the perfect tool for all portrait photographers. It’s perfect for anyone who needs a versatile telephoto lens that can cope with many situations including weddings, events, studio or indoor/outdoor photography.\n\nCapture portraits in superb detail and live for the story\n\nThis fast portrait lens delivers clear, sharp images full of contrast and colour with razor sharp detail, ideal for high-resolution sensors. Air Sphere Coating (ASC) helps suppress internal ghosting and flare while a large f/1.4 aperture produces a shallow depth of field.\n\nLarge, bright aperture for a focused performance in all light levels\n\nA fast aperture of f/1.4 allows precise focusing and faster shutter speeds even in low light. The shallow depth-of-field afforded by a wide maximum aperture gives pleasing bokeh, adding extra depth to portraits.\n\nSmooth and precise 4-stop image stabilisation\n\nChallenging light can make or break a good picture. The 4-stops of image stabilisation will help negate camera shake and give photographers and filmmakers working in difficult shooting conditions an added advantage, just when they need it most.\n\nResponsive, high-speed and precise AF for exceptional focus agility\n\nThanks to latest AF technology the lens reacts quickly and accurately, allowing near-silent focusing. Clear focus markings and full AF compatibility with all EOS systems makes this lens the perfect companion for photographers and filmmakers.\n\nDurable construction, exceptional weather resistance, total compatibility\n\nA durable construction including a shock absorbing front barrel gives high levels of performance in all conditions. Fluorine coatings on the front and rear lens elements help protect against dust and moisture while precise distance markings allow for E-TTL calculations when using flash.\n\nWhere artistry meets performance\n\nA camera is only as good as the lens it is connected to, and all L-series lenses have been engineered to perform at the highest level. Full AF compatibility with Dual Pixel CMOS AF sensors means this lens will deliver outstanding results in both stills and video.",,,taxable,,1,,,0,0,,,,,1,,,1912.34,Photography > Canon,Other Electronics,,,https://webmall-2.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/videonorm.ie_119.jpg,,,,,,,,,0,

Revel in an atmospheric mood at dusk against a breathtaking backdrop – as an inconspicuous observer, the telephoto lens is able to draw you into this unique moment from afar. The ZEISS Milvus 2/135 permits an interplay between fore- and background that is simply incomparable. It can be used in a host of different situations, meaning you can capture the artist’s emotions onstage from your third-row seat, as well as breathtaking portraits in outstanding detail. The position of the focus rings, which does not change, also makes the lens suitable for video applications with a follow focus system.  \n\nA lens design with relatively few glass-to-air surfaces, invented by Dr. Ludwig Bertele at ZEISS in 1930 to provide the fastest lenses of that day for 35 mm photography offering speeds up to f/1.5 and well controlled veiling glare. This is where the name comes from, containing the German word for sun, ’Sonne’, the symbol of utmost brightness.  \n\nExcellent imagery, even in difficult light conditions  \nAll lenses features a T*® antireflective coating from ZEISS. Outstanding stray light reduction is achieved by combining a number of optimally matched measures. In addition to the ZEISS T* coating, all lens edges are provided with a special pitch-black lacquer in a complex manual process. Light traps in mechanical components and specially designed surfaces are integrated to prevent the occurrence of reflections. Each focal length has its own individual optical design with the use of special types of glass displaying anomalous partial dispersion. This reduces the occurrence of color fringes at high-contrast edges of subjects to an absolute minimum.  \n\nFuture-proof solution for high-resolution camera systems  \nThe excellent image performance of the ZEISS Milvus lenses is sharply focused on the requirements of current and future high-performance digital cameras. Thanks to the low level of stray light allowed by the lens design, high-contrast images are also possible with increasing high dynamic ranges of the sensors (HDR). The minimization of coma, astigmatism and spherical aberrations enables constantly high resolution over the entire image field. The optics are designed to ensure full utilization of the performance provided by high-resolution camera systems. Regardless of what the future holds – with the Milvus lenses from ZEISS you are optimally equipped any time, any place.  \n\nCreative still and video photography through precise, manual focusing  \nManually focusing a lens means controlling and therefore actively composing an image gently and precisely from your fingertips. Here, a good ergonomic design makes all the difference. ZEISS Milvus lenses feature a large rotation angle which enables pinpoint focusing. The top-quality focusing mechanism moves smoothly without backlash, optimally supporting the photographer's creative interplay with the focal plane of high-speed fixed focal lengths. Changes are immediately visible in the viewfinder or display. The engraving in meters and feet, and the focus scale provide additional support for manual focusing. The silent, continuous aperture setting (de-click function with ZF.2 mount) and the long focusing range lay optimal conditions for video photography.  \n\nLong-lasting product with protection against environmental influences  \nAn optimized ergonomic design enables fatigue-free photography and reduces camera shake. The all-metal housing makes every adjustment a haptic experience. The dynamic, precise barrel design sets new trends in the world of camera lenses. However, the ZEISS Milvus lenses will impress you not only due to their visual and haptic excellence, but also thanks to their inner qualities. Special seals for protection against dust and splashes expand the photographer's creative potential by guaranteeing the system's functional reliability even in environmentally difficult situations.  \n\nStable image performance over the entire focusing range  \nState-of-the-art camera systems and high-resolution digital image sensors are now demanding more and more performance from the lenses. The Floating Elements Design permits constantly high image performance in the focal plane – from the minimum object distance to infinity. This is accomplished by changing the axial distance between individual lens elements or element groups. The adjustment of the element spacing is coupled to the distance setting so that it always results in the right correction. The mechanical design of the ZEISS Milvus lenses is highly complex and the workmanship must be extremely exact – both specialties of ZEISS.",,,taxable,,1,,,0,0,,,,,1,,,2146.42,Photography > Canon,Other Electronics,,,https://webmall-2.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/videonorm.ie_96.jpg,,,,,,,,,0,

4876,simple,,,SONY FE 100–400 MM G MASTER SUPER-TELEPHOTO ZOOM LENS - SEL100400GM,1,0,visible,"G Master super-telephoto zoom lens with a versatile 100 mm to 400 mm focal length range, ideal for sports, wildlife, and other distant subjects.","G Master super-telephoto zoom  \nThis top-performance G Master zoom lens covers a broad 100 mm to 400 mm focal length range that is ideal for sports, wildlife, and other subjects that require a long reach. It offers image quality and AF performance that will support professional fieldwork, tracking and capturing even fast-moving subjects with outstanding resolution and clarity.\n\nFast, tenacious autofocus  \nThe optimal combination of double linear motor and DDSSM (Direct Drive SSM) drive systems is the first of its kind. It also implements precision sensors that provide real-time feedback for extremely high positioning accuracy, allowing the body's AF system to perform at its best.\n\nHigh resolution at any focal length  \nPrecision 0 7B07B0 optics ensure consistently high corner-to-corner resolution at any focusing distance throughout the lens' zoom range. The SEL100400GM not only delivers stunning images of distant subjects at super-telephoto focal lengths, it offers equally high performance when shooting nearby subjects as well.\n\nNatural rendering and colour  \nTwo ED (Extra-low Dispersion) glass elements and one Super ED glass element strategically deployed in an advanced optical design effectively suppress axial chromatic aberration that is often a cause of resolution falloff in telephoto lenses. The result is exceptionally clear, well-defined images.\n\nClarity and contrast in any light  \nSony's Nano AR Coating suppresses spurious reflections that can cause flare and ghosting in backlit and other challenging lighting situations, for consistently high contrast and clarity. Reduced flare, particularly when shooting in bright outdoor conditions, means greater framing and composing flexibility.  \n(1. Nano AR coating / 2. Glass / 3. Transmitted light)\n\nCompact, lightweight and mobile  \nMagnesium alloy components and other refinements contribute to high durability as well as class-leading size and weight reductions that not only mean greater mobility, but improved manageability with lightweight bodies for easier, more stable handheld shooting.\n\nZoom torque adjustment  \nThis is the first lens to include a zoom smoothness adjuster that provides mechanical control of zoom ring torque. Set a lower torque for fast zooming, or increase torque when slow, stable zooming is required. Fine adjustment allows the feel of the lens to be matched to individual user needs.\n\nClear, blur-free images without a tripod  \nBuilt-in Optical SteadyShot image stabilization makes it easier to capture blur-free images, particularly when shooting sports or other subjects that require fast stabilization response. Mode 2 stabilization facilitates dynamic panned shots. 5-axis stabilization becomes available when used with series bodies that feature in-body stabilization.\n\nOutstanding shooting versatility  \nFloating focus and high positioning precision have made it possible to achieve a minimum focus distance of just 0.98 meters (3.22 ft.) with up to 0.35x magnification. You have a versatile 100 mm to 400 mm super-telephoto zoom range, plus outstanding close-up performance at 100 mm.\n\nCustomizable focus hold button  \nConveniently located focus hold buttons provide focus hold control even during continuous AF operation. They can also be customized from a camera menu that allows them to be assigned to a variety of different functions.\n\nRemovable tripod mount  \nA removable tripod mount allows quick attachment to or removal from a tripod so the user can easily switch between tripod and handheld shooting. The mount can also be removed for convenient transport and storage. A lock mechanism prevents accidental removal.\n\nTeleconverters for extra reach  \nSEL100400GM is fully compatible with the high-performance SEL14TC and SEL20TC teleconverters for a 1.4x or 2x increase in focal length, respectively. That's a maximum focal length of 800 mm (1,200 mm on an APS-C format body).\n\nFluorine coated front element  \nThe lens' front element features a fluorine coating that helps to prevent dirt and fingerprints from sticking, and makes it easier to wipe dirt and fingerprints away if they do become attached to the lens surface. This can be a significant advantage for outdoor shooting.\n\nHigh reliability in harsh conditions  \nThe overall design of this lens is dust and moisture resistant for extra protection and reliable operation in challenging environments. Shoot with confidence in light rain or windy conditions.\n\nPro lens hood features  \nAn access window that can be opened or closed as required allows easy access for polarizing filter operation, and a hood lock switch prevents accidental detachment or rotation of the lens hood while shooting or moving around.",,,taxable,,1,,,0,0,,,,,1,,,2277.99,Photography,Other Electronics,,,https://webmall-2.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/hdtvandelectronics.com_18.jpg,,,,,,,,,0,

It was, in fact, a 802.11a/b/g/n wireless access point with four internal MIMO antennas. Yes, we were just as shocked as you surely are now. We hope you’re sitting down, or that you have a nice glass of cold water handy to refresh yourself. The news that the Adtran BSAP-1920 (1700954F1) is wireless access point is massive.

By digitally capturing music at a higher rate than CD, High-Resolution Audio allows you to get closer to the original studio recording and enjoy your music just as the artist intended.\n\n70-mm HD driver units deliver high quality sound  \nNewly developed HD driver units with a large diameter of 70 mm, designed to cover most people's ears, produce a plane wave front similar to that in a natural sound field and reproduce frequencies from 4 Hz–100 kHz. Every note stays precise and clear across a spacious sound stage, reproducing the emotion and energy of the original recording, with true vocal clarity and precise bass response.\n\nFibonacci-patterned grill for smooth ultra-highs  \nFibonacci-patterned grill inherited from MDR-Z1R reproduces the intended sound properties smoothly. It is made of stiff resin to achieve both thinness and strength and minimise sound damping from the grill at ultra-high frequencies.\n\nAluminium-coated LCP diaphragm for more precision  \nAn aluminum-coated liquid crystal polymer diaphragm gives a more consistent and precise sound across the entire frequency range. Combining aluminum and LCP, material-specific resonance is cancelled and delivers natural sound with low colouration.\n\nApprox. 200% bigger Dynamic Neodymium Magnet  \nWith a newly developed magnetic circuit and bigger magnet, double the size of the MDR-Z7, the MDR-Z7M2 establishes more driving power and a fast response to high resolution signals, resulting in sharp clarity of sound.\n\n4.4-mm balanced cable connection  \nEnjoy clear, precise and dynamic sound with a 4.4-mm balanced connection cable, which separates left and right sound signals and reduces noise from the output signal.\n\nSilver-coated oxygen free copper cable  \nSilver-coated oxygen-free copper cables enable minimized resistance and signal-transmission loss. The result is less sound degradation, finer detail and smoother treble sounds.\n\nErgonomic earpads  \nA combination of three-dimensionally sewn synthetic leather surfaces and very thick low-repulsion urethane foam cushion provides an ergonomic shape to fit to the unevenness of the head and gives even pressure throughout the area. This reduces sound leakage by increasing the air-tightness and delivers the very best powerful heavy bass.\n\nAluminium-alloyed hanger and slider  \nAluminium alloy is used for hangers and sliders, which form the backbone of the headphones.
