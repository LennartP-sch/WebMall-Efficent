A host of video functions such as 6K oversampled 4K 30p capture and Dual Pixel CMOS AF II makes the EOS R50 a great camera for movie recording and vlogging as well. The 24.2 Megapixel APS-C size CMOS Image sensor and DIGIC X image processor ensure high image quality in a compact and lightweight form factor.nFEATURESn24.2 Megapixel (APS-C) CMOS SensornEquipped with a 24.2-million-pixel CMOS (APS-C) image sensor and DIGIC X Image Processor, the EOS R50 camera can capture images and videos with reduced noise, delivering clear, detailed results even in low light. Images look beautiful even when enlarged, with natural bokeh that smartphones can&rsquo;t offer.nDual Pixel CMOS AF IInEasily keep track of your subject with Dual Pixel CMOS AF II &ndash; a highly responsive system that covers up to approximately 100% x 100% of the picture area, breaking the image into up to 651 automatically-selected AF zones during Whole Area AF. This enables impressive autofocus coverage on the EOS R50 camera that helps you get the photo you want right as the moment happens.nAutomatic Subject Detection and TrackingnWhen the subject is found on screen, the EOS R50 camera can automatically select and track the subject, enabling photography that keeps them in focus with ease. Developed using Deep Learning Technology, subjects like people, animals including dogs, cats and birds, and vehicles such as cars and motorcycles &mdash; especially in a motorsports environment &ndash; are detectable.nContinuous ShootingnCapture those can&rsquo;t-miss moments with up to 12 frames per second continuous shooting using the Electronic First Curtain shutter mode, and up to 15 frames per second with Electronic Shutter mode. Electronic First Curtain enables shooting with less distortion, even for subjects with significant movement. The Electronic Shutter generates no shutter noise, making it useful when photographing sleeping children, concerts, dance recitals, and other situations where silence is necessary.nAdvanced A+ AssistnExperience the joy of creative photography with an expanded array of auto-compatible scenes. Advanced A+ Assist on the EOS R50 camera enables great imagery even in difficult settings such as night views and backlit scenarios. Overexposure is automatically reduced so you can capture dynamic scenes or bright portraits, and multiple continuous shots are taken to create beautiful night images or macro photography with a deeper depth of field.nVlogging Made Simple and ConvenientnWith video recording features such as 6K oversampled uncropped 4K movie at up to 30 fps, Full-HD High-frame rate movie recording at up to 120 fps, Dual Pixel CMOS AF tracking, and Movie for Close-up Demo Mode, the EOS R50 camera makes vlogging and video content creation simple and convenient.nContinuous Movie Recording That Exceeds 30 MinutesnThe EOS R50 camera can continuously record video for up to 1 hour, allowing you to set up your video and keep your vlog, podcast, or other video project rolling without worrying about it stopping.nMovie for Close-Up Demos ModenEnsure the correct subject is in focus with Movie for Close-up Demos Mode on the EOS R50 camera. This mode quickly switches focus from the on-camera subject to an object that is presented towards the camera&rsquo;s lens, ideal for movies where showing a product to the viewers is necessary such as in makeup demos, or cooking videos.nVertical Movie Mode and Aspect MarkersnMovie rotation information can be set during or after movie recording, allowing videos to be played in vertical composition when viewing on a smartphone.
