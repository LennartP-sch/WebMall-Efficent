Delivering a super wide 15-27mm equivalent zoom range, and offering a constant f/4 aperture, this lens can produce high-quality images in a variety of difficult scenarios. The implementation of one Super ED and three aspherical elements further guarantees image quality by minimizing aberrations throughout the range. Also, the lens is equipped with Optical SteadyShot image stabilization for reducing the effects of camera shake. Beyond these features, the lens also features an internal focus design that enables fast, responsive autofocus and a minimum focus distance of 9.8"". Additionally, it has a seven-blade circular diaphragm for smooth bokeh. Designed for APS-C-format E-mount cameras, this ultra-wide-angle 10-18mm lens will provide a 15-27mm equivalent zoom range. A constant f/4 maximum aperture offers consistent performance throughout the zoom range and also lends greater control over focus position for shallow depth of field techniques. One Super ED (extra-low dispersion) glass element is featured in the lens design to help reduce chromatic aberrations and color fringing for improved clarity and color neutrality. Three aspherical elements are incorporated in the lens design to reduce astigmatism, field curvature, coma, and other monochromatic aberrations. Optical SteadyShot image stabilization helps to minimize the appearance of camera shake for sharper imagery when shooting handheld with slower shutter speeds. This stabilization system can also be combined with select camera's sensor-shift type image stabilization for more effective control of camera blur. An internal focus mechanism contributes to faster, more responsive autofocus, the minimum focus distance of 9.8"", and easier handling as the lens does not change in length during use. Rounded seven-blade diaphragm contributes to a pleasing bokeh quality when employing selective focus techniques.",,,taxable,,1,,,0,0,,,,,1,,,"632,0",Visual Art > Lenses,Other Electronics,,,https://webmall-3.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/splashuwimaging.com_49.jpg,,,,,,,,,0,

This new generation of TL-SG1024DE 24-Port Gigabit Easy Smart Switch features the latest energy-efficient technologies that can greatly expand your networkâ€™s capacity with much less power. It automatically adjusts power consumption according to the link status and cable length to limit the carbon footprint of your network.Â Power down Idle Ports When a computer or network equipment is off, the corresponding port of a traditional switch will continue to consume considerable amounts of power. The TL-SG1024DE can automatically detect the link status of each port and reduce the power consumption of ports that are idle. Â Power Budget According to Cable Length Ideally, shorter cables would use less power with less power degradation over their length; this is not the case with most devices as they will use the same amount of power across the cable regardless of whether it is 10 or 50 meters in length. The TL-SG1024DE analyzes the length of the Ethernet cable connected and adjusts the power usage accordingly, rather than keeping the power consumption in a conventional solution.Â Ease of Use TL-SG1024DE is easy to use and manage. Auto MDI/MDI-X crossover on all ports eliminates the need for crossover cables or uplink ports. Auto-negotiation on each port senses the link speed of a network device (either 10, 100, or 1000 Mbps) and intelligently adjusts for compatibility and optimal performance. Its compact size makes it ideal for desktops with limited space while also being rack-mountable, convenient and safe.

Beats Studio Buds are engineered to deliver powerful, balanced sound in a compact design, through an entirely customized acoustic platform. A proprietary, dual-element diaphragm driver resides within a two-chamber housing, resulting in clear sound with outstanding stereo separation. An advanced digital processor then optimizes audio performance for loudness and clarity, while simultaneously ensuring clean noise-cancellation. The result — immersive sound that pulls the emotion of music from the studio to your ears to keep you going all day long. CONTROL THE NOISE With two distinct listening modes, you are in total control of your sound. Active Noise Cancelling (ANC) continuously blocks unwanted outside noise using a finely-tuned filter that dynamically adapts to your surroundings. When you need to hear the world around you, switch to Transparency mode at the press of a button. The external-facing microphones mix the sounds of your surroundings back in with your music for a natural, ‘open’ listening experience. POWER YOUR DAY The earbuds have up to 8 hours of listening time1 with two additional charges provided by its pocket-sized charging case.2 That means that Beats Studio Buds give you up to 24 hours of combined playback. With ANC or Transparency mode turned on, you’ll get up to 5 hours of listening time, 15 combined with the case. If you need a little extra juice, 5-minute Fast Fuel charging gives up to 1 hour of playback3 when battery is low. Now that’s wireless freedom. CHOOSE YOUR FIT Three soft, silicone eartip sizes (small, medium, or large) give you a customized fit and create an acoustic seal for an even more immersive listening experience. These size options provide comfort, stability, and the confidence of staying put. Beats Studio Buds were made to fit seamlessly into your life with its sleek, compact in-ear design. Its matching charging case offers superior portability with a rounded, slim design that easily fits in your pocket or purse. Even better, the earbuds themselves offer an IPX4 rating for sweat and water resistance.4 KEEP THE CONNECTION With Class 1 Bluetooth® technology, Beats Studio Buds offer extended wireless range and fewer dropouts. Dual-beam forming microphones target your voice and filter out wind and external noise for high-quality call performance and elevated voice clarity. On-ear controls allow you to manage calls and control music. You’ll also be able to customize the “Press and Hold” function to work for either ANC or your voice assistant.5 COMPATIBLE WITH APPLE AND ANDROID Beats Studio Buds feature simple one-touch pairing for Apple6 and Android devices7 and easily connect via Bluetooth. With the Beats app for Android, you’ll get features like built-in controls, device status (i.e. battery levels), and firmware updates. With Apple devices, those features are built in to iOS with no app required, and and you can also activate Siri hands-free just by saying “Hey Siri”.8 And the USB-C charge connector provides a single charging solution across both Apple and Android platforms. 1 Testing conducted by Apple in April 2021 using preproduction Beats Studio Buds and Charging Case units and software paired with iPhone 11 Pro Max units and prerelease software.

This cable is fully compatible with the following Sony consoles from any region : ⚫︎ PlayStation 2 regular ⚫︎ PlayStation 2 slim ⚫︎ PlayStation 3 (in RGB mode) for games using 240p/480i only. Recommended for PS1 hardware emulation (in compatible systems) or downloads of older PlayStation games that aren’t upscaled to 720/1080p. There are two cable options in the “cable length/type” menu: Fortraflex is a highly graded individually shielded, highly flexible cable made to order by Tasker of Italy for our company. All signal lines are individually shielded with pure copper strand wrap to eliminate crosstalk-induced artifacts. The outer casing is a soft and flexible polymer used commonly in professional microphone cables or high end wired game controllers (eg: official SNES controllers) to allow for increased mobility. 75 ohm multicore coax cable is a professional grade cable that maintains an impedance of 75 ohms to completely prevent signal reflection. This is the highest possible grade of cable possible for video signals, and we’re the only company in the world offering this as an option for SCART. Each line is individually shielded with copper wrap as well as having the grounds isolated from other signals via color coded PVC coating. This cable is also made to order for us by Tasker of Italy. Coaxial cable is thick, but it's the best option if you need a longer cable. Please note: This cable is wired to the SCART standard used in Europe.
